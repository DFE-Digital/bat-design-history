A collection of terms commonly used across the Becoming a Teacher service lines.

Accredited
: Accreditation is the means by which institutions are authorised to award degrees by DfE. 'Accredited' in effect means 'able to award degrees'. An accredited body can authorise other organisations to offer courses leading to a degree - the degree is awarded by the accredited body.

Accredited body (Accredited provider)
: A provider that has the DfE approved authority to deliver a training programme that leads to qualified teacher status (QTS). Accredited bodies must ensure that they remain compliant with the ITT criteria. Other providers can partner with an accredited body to deliver a course that leads to QTS. They do not accredit anyone.

Allocation
: Permission to run limited courses.

Becoming a teacher (BAT)
: Our service line.

Bursaries AND Scholarships
: These are sums of money available to trainees on (fee-based) courses in certain subjects. They're tax-free, and awarded by DfE, in some cases in partnership with professional bodies. The main difference between bursaries and scholarships is that the value of scholarships is a little higher, and you'll generally need a 2:1 to qualify for one (you'll only need a 2:2 to get a bursary). You also have to apply for a scholarship, whereas you'll automatically receive a bursary once you start training (if you meet the criteria). You can only claim one of them - not both.

Course
: A training programme providers create for candidates to apply to.

Course Code
: A code used to identify courses (unique to a provider).

Cycle
: The period during which ITT applications are open, usually beginning in October and ending in September.

DTTP
: [Database of trainee teachers and providers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/database-of-trainee-teachers-and-providers-dttp).

Early career payments
: These apply to chemistry, languages, maths and physics. They're sums of money you get after you've qualified as a teacher - they're paid out in your second, third and fourth year of teaching. You get £2k each year - £3k in some parts of the country.

English Baccalaureate (EBacc)
: A combination of subjects (the 'core' subjects, academically) that pupils can study at GCSE level. The EBacc is not a qualification in itself. The government assesses school performance based on how well pupils perform in the EBacc subjects. It's also used as something of a marketing device - pupils are encouraged to choose these subjects.

Early years initial teacher training (EYITT)
: EYITT status allows you to teach 0 to 5 year olds. It's equivalent to QTS, but exclusively for that specific age group.

Further Education
: This is an educational level between secondary and higher education. It tends to be vocational. Most people studying FE courses will be over 16, but some courses are available to people aged 14 and over. FE courses are usually taught in FE colleges, sixth form colleges, and adult education centres (ie not schools). Strictly speaking, A Levels are part of FD - however, the term is generally used to refer to non-academic, vocational/skills-focused training.

Get into teaching (GiT)
: Campaign site to encourage people to apply for teacher training.

Higher education institution (HEI)
: A university.

Initial teacher training (ITT)
: The training you have to do to become a teacher. It's usually fine to say 'teacher training' rather than 'initial teacher training'. The 'ITT' abbreviation should be avoided - instead say teacher training, or just training.

Multi-Academy Trust (MAT)
: A single trust responsible for a group of academies. MATs can be providers but cannot be lead schools.

Organisation
: There's no clear definition for this. We use it broadly to encompass the different types of entity involving in teacher training (schools, universities, School Directs, etc). So it's a catch-all, umbrella term.

Postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE)
: This is a teaching qualification that - when it's paired with QTS (qualified teacher status) - allows you to teach in state schools in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It’s also recognised internationally (which is the major advantage of having it, over just QTS). PGCE without QTS qualifies you to teach further education, but not primary or secondary education.

Provider led
: A course that that is led by an HEI or a SCITT (the opposite of school led/based).

Qualified teacher status (QTS)
: This is the qualification you need to teach in state schools in England. You can't teach without it.

Rollover
: This takes place in Publish - it's the copying over of courses from one recruitment cycle to the next. It starts in mid July and takes about a month in full. All courses are copied over; training providers can then eliminate any courses they don't want to run, and make any other changes to ensure their course profiles are correct for the upcoming cycle.

Scholarships
: See Bursaries.

SCITT
: School-centred initial teacher training provider. A SCITT is most commonly a school who have incorporated a separate legal entity (company) dedicated to delivering teacher training. SCITTs are accredited bodies.

School direct (SD)
: Single school given school direct (fee and salaried) places. Must partner with an accredited body.

SITS
: SITS:Vision, also known just as SITS, is a database application used for course and student management in further and higher education institutions, developed and maintained by the [Tribal Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SITS:Vision).

Teacher Analysis Division (TAD)
: Part of DfE.

Teaching School Alliance
: Outstanding schools that work with others to provide high quality training to new and experienced staff. Cannot be lead schools or providers.

Teacher supply model (TSM)
: Used to predict and manage the ITT market.

UCAS
: The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service whose main role is to operate the application process for British universities.
