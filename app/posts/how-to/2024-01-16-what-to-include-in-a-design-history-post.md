Design histories are an archival tool that helps team members and people working on anything related understand:

- what prompted a change
- what changed
- the decisions that led to the change

Design history posts should record significant changes to your service. Avoid writing them for small or self-explanatory modifications, such as minor wording updates or adjustments to match the design system.

Include design and research that you have not implemented. For example, if an experiment is tried but not taken live, document it. Often, this work is the most valuable use of a design history post to ensure the work and lessons learned are not lost.

## Describe design decisions

A good design history succinctly covers the design decisions made. In this context, ‘design’ encompasses all activities in planning and implementing a change. Documenting research and including relevant policy, product, and development decisions is vital.

Not all design history posts will include research. Sometimes, changes are made without it or put live and monitored.

When describing design decisions, try to cover:

- your planned changes and why these were considered the best approach, including a summary of any research that informed your planning
- the outcome of research that increased or decreased your certainty about the original plan
- any revisions you made based on the research conducted
- alternative approaches considered, and why you rejected them

Repeat these steps as necessary for the iterations you make.

## Show what cannot easily be seen

Help your reader understand the user journey. If there are changes that only some users see or happen in certain states, show the different states, how the routes diverge, and what triggers them. A good example is what happens when a user does or does not have JavaScript enabled.

If the change includes sending emails or other communications to users, include these as well.

## Write for people in a hurry

Your users’ primary needs will be to simply and quickly understand how you previously made decisions. With that in mind:

- write the most straightforward and shortest post you can
- use headings and bullet points to aid reading
- follow the [GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z) and the [DfE style guide](https://design.education.gov.uk/content-design/style-guide)
