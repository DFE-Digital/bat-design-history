## What we did

In August we sent out the first emails to a beta cohort of trainee teachers beginning their training via School-Centered Initial Teacher Training (SCITTs) and universities. These were sent through Mailchimp and included subject line A/B tests to understand what kind of messaging would drive engagement.

- SCITT trainees: 3,135 recipients, sent on Sunday 24 August at 9.30am.
- University trainees: 5,673 recipients, sent on Sunday 24 August at 9.30am.

Each group received two subject line variants:

1. |FNAME|, prepare for your training and read advice from past trainees
2. |FNAME|, you're almost ready to start your training!

## What we learned

### Overall engagement

- Open rates were very similar across both subject lines and groups, averaging around 16%.

- Click-through rates (CTR) showed clearer differences, particularly among university trainees.

- Unsubscribe and spam reports were very low overall (8 people across both campaigns).

### SCITT trainees

- Open rate: ~17.6% across both subject lines.

- CTR: ~4.3%.

- The subject line test did not show a clear winner at this stage. Both performed very similarly.

- Engagement was strongest among younger recipients.

### University trainees

- Open rate: ~16% across both subject lines.

- CTR: 5.3% for the first subject line (prepare for your training and read advice from past trainees) compared with 4.8% for the second.

- This suggests that mentioning past trainees in the subject line increased engagement.

- Again, engagement was higher among younger recipients.

### Call-to-action engagement

Across both SCITT and university groups, most people clicked on the first call-to-action ("how to prepare for training") rather than the second ("read advice from former trainees"). For example, in the University test 2 email:

- 129 people clicked the first CTA.

- 50 people clicked the second CTA.

This suggests people are more interested in preparation advice, though the placement and visual hierarchy of the buttons may also influence this.

## What’s next

We’ll continue to monitor engagement over time to see if differences between subject lines become clearer, particularly for SCITT trainees where results are currently very close. We’ll also explore ways to balance CTA prominence so we can better understand content preferences versus visual placement.

We also plan to send more emails to the beta cohort of trainees soon.
