## What we did

We have introduced a checklist component on the 'How to prepare for teacher training
' page in the Get ready to teach service to bring a sense of continuity with the G<a href="https://child-development-training.education.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Get into teaching</a> service and overall teaching brand.

This alignment helps users feel confident that they are still within the same service line. By reusing components, we aim to build trust and make the transition between touchpoints smoother and more familiar.

To help trainees notice and engage with this content, we introduced an information card component. This component was adapted from the <a href="https://child-development-training.education.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Early years child development training</a> service where it is being used successfully to highlight key learning points.

## Purpose of the component

- Draw attention to something useful within longer content.
- Provide a clear, scannable signpost so users know something is important.
- Create consistency with other DfE services by reusing an established component.

## Whatâ€™s next

We plan to monitor this component with:

- Analytics: such as click-through rates on links within the card component.
- Feedback: whether trainees report finding resources more easily.

We also plan to explore opportunities to use the information card across other areas of the Get ready to teach service.
