## What we did

We have adopted a checklist component on the How to prepare for teacher training page, based on the one used in the <a href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Get into teaching</a> service. We aim for this to bring a sense of continuity with the GIT service and overall teaching brand as well as make content easier to read.

This alignment in design helps users feel confident that they are still within the same service line. By reusing components, we aim to build trust and make the transition between touchpoints smoother and more familiar.

## Why we are using it

- Continuity: adopting the existing checklist design reinforces brand recognition and consistency across the service line.
- Clarity: presenting content in concise, block-level items makes information easier to scan and digest.
- Encouragement: breaking steps down into a checklist creates a sense of progress and makes tasks feel more achievable.

## Whatâ€™s next

We plan to monitor this component with:

- Analytics: for example, tracking click-through rates on checklist links or changes in scroll depth after adding the component.
- Feedback: whether trainees report finding resources more easily.

We also plan to explore opportunities to use the checklist component across other areas of the Get ready to teach service.
