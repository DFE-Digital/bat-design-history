We created a concept test prototype to explore what content and features trainee teachers would find most useful on a digital hub during their training year. This work aimed to validate early assumptions and inform future design and development decisions.

## What prompted this work

* Our first research round highlighted a gap in consistent, accessible support for trainee teachers across providers, particularly in the early parts of their training and while waiting to begin their course.

* Stakeholders expressed interest in a centralised hub to support trainees with guidance and resources after receiving a place on a course

* We needed to test which concepts resonated most with users before progressing to development.

We designed a mid-fidelity prototype to test the following concepts with trainees from both SCITT and University based routes and gauge what they would find most useful:

* A structured timeline of the training year

* Access to signposted teaching resources such as lesson planning, behaviour management and QTS evidencing

* Peer to peer support through a network for trainees

* A checklist for trainees prior to beginning their course

* Signposting to wellbeing and support services

* Events for trainees

* A feedback mechanism where trainees can report on the effectiveness of their training course and experience  

## What we learned

The preparation based content such as the timeline of the training year and having checklists for training tested well with users as they found it would be useful for when they're waiting to be inducted by their providers.

The peer support network didn't test as effectively as it seemed most trainees already had a network they could turn to if needed and some had concerns a network wouldn't be used to foster a positive environment around training.

Trainees also found signposted resources on lesson plans, behaviour management and wellbeing useful despite most of them having similar resources available through their inidividual courses, many felt having more would be helpful and even said they would trust dfe approved resources more than a generic google search.

## Next steps

The testing with users enabled us to determine a foundation for MVP based on the concepts they found most beneficial to their training. Next steps will be iterating our prototype to strip back the additional concepts and writing the content for MVP as accurately as we can based on the information we have. Then we would be in a position to test with providers to gain their insights on if the content supports what they give their trainees of if any of it is contradictory.
