We wanted to A/B test two designs of the proposed service to see what inpact the teacher services branding and logo would have on engagement with content.

## What prompted this work

We recently [tested concepts for a trainee support hub]('/testing-concepts/'), and wanted to create a hi-fidelity prototype based on feedback and internal discussions that would allow people to browse freely across the support pages.

We have recently created two designs, one that follows the DFE design look and feel (test A) and the second (test B) introducing design elements from the Get into teaching (GIT) service on top of the DFE design. The primary reason for this is to test if these design elements are familiar to trainee teachers and if this service can be seen as a continuation of the service line supporting teachers.

The differences between test A and B include:

* only having the teaching every lesson shapes a life logo on the version B homepage

* only having the Get into teaching colour palette on elements on the version B homepage

* only having the Get into teaching block colour headings on the version B homepage

* only having the Get into teaching block colour headings on the version B homepage

* only haviny a banner with an image and Get in to teaching headers on the version B article category pages

* only having block headers and yellow inset elements on version B article pages

We are interested to see if the influence of the subtle design changes has an impact on the experience when using the service.

### Home page concepts

Homepage test A, based on the DFE design guidance.

Homepage test B, based on the DFE design guidance but including elements of Get into teaching.

## How we set up the A/B test

To try and create a tangible experience in user research, we decided to start both A and B journeys with an email concept. This allowed us to create forks in the journey. We also created a form on each page that would submit which test we pointed them to using the GOV prototype kit data attributes to store the test version in the session.

### Personalising the email and homepage

We also want to understand if including the first name of trainee teachers in both the email and homepage has a positive impact on engagement. This is something we have adopted from the Teaching Vacancies service because it improved the engagement of teachers using their service.

We are currently using UTM queries in the prototype to emulate personalisation on the  email and homepage.

## Next steps

We will be conducting user research sessions soon to focus on the design and user experience of the service. We aim to write a follow up post about this and any design changes that have been influenced by the research.
