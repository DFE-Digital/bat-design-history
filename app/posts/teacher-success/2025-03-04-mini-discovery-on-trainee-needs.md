Despite having access to existing insight on the trainee experience, there were gaps in our deeper understanding of why key problems existed and what, if anything, was being done about them. 

For example, we needed a deeper understanding about what contributed to trainee workload and what might alleviate it. We also needed to understand why mentors and placements were not meeting trainee needs and expectations. 

While the previous team had created a set of user needs, these were quite high level and we needed to expand our knowledge as we progressed into alpha to help us problem solve effectively. 

## Goals for research 

1. Understand what support and information trainees need and when.
2. Understand who supports trainees and how effective is this.
3. Investigate what contributes to trainee workload and what might help alleviate this.

## Research approach 

We ran 12 interviews with former trainees and mapped their experience, highlighting key pain point and needs before, during and after training. 

For our alpha, we decided to focus our research and development on those doing a postgraduate teacher training year through a university or a school or group of schools (SCITTs). 

This is because our data indicates that these users have one of the lowest experience scores out of all potential routes into teaching and highest dropout rates. They are also the largest cohort.

## Key findings 

### Unclear expectations

Some trainees start their course and first placement without a clear understanding of what to expect. This can lead to anxiety and disappointment during training. 

### Placement experience

A good placement is key to trainee success but existing school pressures and a mismatch in expectations between the trainee and school staff can cause some trainees to enter challenging placements. 

### High workload

Workload is too high and is caused by increased teaching hours combining with:

- clashing postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) assignments
- qualified teacher status (QTS) assessments
- in some cases, the need to complete complex lesson plans

### Support from mentors

Mentors and tutors do not always have the capacity or closeness to provide effective support and sometimes trainees worry that sharing their issues with them may impact their career. 

Using this research and past research, we iterated and built out our first set of user needs.
