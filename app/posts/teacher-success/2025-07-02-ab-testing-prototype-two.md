We recently [A/B tested a prototype](/teacher-success/ab-testing-prototype/) with trainee teachers during user research sessions. Based on their feedback, we’ve made several design changes and identified areas we plan to monitor going forward.

Overall, we found people preferred route B, which adopted design elements from the Get Into Teaching (GIT) service. People found this more engaging with some recognising the brand, which strengthened the appeal of route B because we want this service to be an obvious touch point in services dedicated to teachers.

## Design changes based on user feedback

The current changes include:

* updating breadcrumbs to say 'Home' instead of 'Get ready to teach'

* removing block text headers with yellow backgrounds on content pages

* changing the links to resources section on content pages

### Updating breadcrumbs

We found in some research sessions that people did not know how to return to the homepage. The research sessions highlighted that the 'Get ready to teach' service name in the service banner and the 'Get ready to teach' link in the breadcrumb were not clear ways to return to the homepage.

We have since updated the breadcrumb to say 'Home' as per GDS design system guidance and will monitor the service name link in the service banner going forward.

### Removing block text headers with yellow backgrounds on content pages

While some people liked the use of yellow background on header text on content pages, others felt it was too distracting and difficult to read. Despite meeting WCAG AAA contrast standards (9.29:1, #1D1D1B on #F9B400), we decided to remove the yellow headers based on user feedback.

Whilst testing route A, which did not adopt the yellow headers, we received no negative feedback in regards to how easy it was to read and therefore we have adopted this approach on content pages going forward.

### Changing the resources section on content pages

We had some feedback that people often missed content blocks at the bottom of some pages that used a yellow inset because they assumed it was the end of the page. This meant they missed the additional resources we linked to. To try and mitigate this, we have adopted the information block from the <a href="https://child-development-training.education.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early years child development training service (link opens in new tab)</a> because it uses an information icon and a blue background to highlight important information.

We plan to monitor if this helps highlight information to people.

## Things we have added to the design

The current new list of design changes include:

* adding a feedback banner to the bottom of all pages

* updating our email header logo from a yellow teacher services logo to a blue logo

### Adding a feedback banner to the bottom of all pages

As this will be a new service, we're keen as a team to get as much feedback as possible, especially on our content pages. To try and get as much feedback as possible post launch, we've adopted the 'is this page useful' feedback banner from the DfE <a href="https://accessibility.education.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accessibility and inclusive design manual</a>.

This banner provides people a way to quickly offer feedback via Yes and No buttons and also provide detailed feedback if they want to.

### Updating our email header logo from a yellow teacher services logo to a blue logo

For consistency across the end-to-end journey, we're aligning the logo used in our emails to match the one on the service home page.

## What we’ll be monitoring

The current things we want to monitor include:

* the hierarchy of card blocks on the home page and if these should be dynamic depending on the time of year

* using the yellow inset at the top of content page to highlight to people that the article contains links to external resources

## Next steps

It is likely we will conduct more user research sessions soon to focus on the design and user experience of the service. We will write a follow up post about any future insights and any design changes that have been influenced by the research.
