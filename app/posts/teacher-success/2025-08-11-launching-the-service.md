## What we did

We recently launched the private beta of Schools Digital’s new Get ready to teach service: <https://teach.education.gov.uk/>

To mark the occasion, we created our first service mission patch, taking inspiration from Finding Nemo. We wanted to echo the story of following someone on a great adventure.

This is the first step in creating a platform that supports teachers throughout their professional journey, from initial teacher training (ITT) to getting a job, passing induction, and developing their career.

## Who we are contacting

An initial cohort of around 7,000 soon-to-be trainees will receive emails soon. These emails signpost them to our (currently unindexed) beta content.

## Our vision

Over time, Get ready to teach will become an increasingly personalised service—adapting to where teachers are in their career, what they teach, and their individual needs and aspirations.

## What’s next

We’ll use feedback from this initial group to refine the content, improve usability, and gradually expand access to more trainees.
