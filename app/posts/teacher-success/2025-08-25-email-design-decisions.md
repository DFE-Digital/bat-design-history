The aim of these emails is to direct trainees to relevant content on the service during our private beta.

#Branding and visual design

We’ve incorporated elements from both the Department for Education and Teaching campaign branding to maintain familiarity and trust. Styling decisions include: 

* use of Arial font, size 16 for body copy and 20 bold for headings/subheadings
* consistent button design: GOV green (#00703C), no rounded corners, Arial 14, with 10px inner padding

We are also using GIT's approved colour palette, including: 

* purple #AD52A4
* yellow #FBBB21
* blue #00B1EB
* green #00AB92
* GOV Green #00703C
* pink #F162A3
* off white #F0F0F0 

##Imagery
Images will be sourced from: 

* Department for Education stock photography
* Teaching-specific visuals

##Layout and spacing standards
To ensure emails are accessible and easy to navigate, we’ve applied the following layout guidance: 

* paragraph spacing: 20px
* button spacing: 30px above and below
* quote blocks: 40px padding all sides, with 25px between quote and attribution
* heading and subheading spacing: variable between 20–30px, adjusted for readability 

##Sign-off

Each email will close with a message that reinforces the value of the teaching journey and our shared mission: 

‘Thank you for helping to shape the next generation  

Get ready to teach  

Department for Education’
