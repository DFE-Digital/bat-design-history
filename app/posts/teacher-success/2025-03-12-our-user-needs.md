From our initial evidence review and our exploratory research with trainees, we created a new set of user needs to help us effectively ideate solutions to their problems.

We have split these by stages in the training journey.

## Early on (prior to training and in the first few weeks)

Trainees who have realistic expectations of the challenges of training and a clear idea of what they’ll be doing in advance of starting are more likely to have a positive training year.

- I need to know how the route or qualification I choose might impact how and where I train to teach so I can choose a course that suits my needs and experience
- I need to know what teaching and teacher training is like so I can decide if it’s for me and come into training prepared
- I need to know how my training year is structured so I understand what I’ll be doing and when and can mentally and practically prepare
- I need sufficient notice of my placement school so I can plan how to get there, arrange childcare and introduce myself before I start
- I need acknowledgment from my provider of my inexperience and reassurance that information will be revisited when needed so I’m less worried about the year ahead
- I need to both seek and offer support to other trainees so I can resolve issues and share my experiences with peers

## While studying and completing assignments

Trainees who understand what they need to do to evidence qualified teacher status (QTS) in a way that is not over burdensome and who are given sufficient time and support on completing assignments are more likely to have a positive training year.

- I need to know what’s expected academically from a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) and how to do this well so I can get my qualification
- I need to know how I’ll be assessed for QTS and what I need to document so I can do this efficiently and not overwork myself
- I need sufficient time and space to complete my assignments so I can do this without feeling overworked
- I need to have the freedom and resources to create lesson plans in a way that meets my needs so I can develop without feeling overworked
- I need to be able to raise issues or concerns about the quality of my training so issues with the course can be improved or resolved

## While on placement

Trainees who are adequately supported by their training provider, mentor and wider school community with access to technology and resources are more likely to have a positive training year.

- I need to have practical information on how to teach and a chance to practice before my first placement, so I have the skills and confidence I need when entering the classroom
- I need all staff in schools to understand what I’m expected to do and how they’re expected to support me so staff in placement schools can support me effectively
- I need access to the systems and technology I need to use in my placement schools so I can teach effectively and develop as a teacher
- I need advice and support on handling poor pupil behaviour so I’m able to handle this while on placement and develop as a teacher
- I need my mentors to have the capacity, skills and recognition needed to effectively mentor me, so I feel supported on placement
- I need to be able to raise concerns about my provider or placement to a neutral third party so that I get advice or support in a way that does not impact my training or career

## Using our needs to make user centred decisions

We are storing and updating our needs in a Microsoft List that our team and other teams in the department have access to.

These have been used as stimuli for a cross-team idea hackathon, and as part of ongoing conversations about what to prioritise for private beta.
