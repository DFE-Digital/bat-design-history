## What we did

We ran a four-email campaign to support a subset of the 2025/26 trainee teacher cohort as they prepared to start their training. The aim was to direct trainees to the Get ready to teach service on teach.education.gov.uk, helping them feel prepared and supported in the early stages of their journey.

## Who we were designing for

Our audience was trainee teachers who had recently accepted a place on a teacher training course starting in Autumn 2025. We targeted a private beta subset of users from the Apply for teacher training service, including a mix of those with and without One Login for Government accounts. This cohort included both SCITT and University trainees.

## What we sent

Between August and September 2025 we sent four themed emails to this smaller cohort. Each campaign A/B tested a subject line and directed readers to specific support content on the site.

- Email 1 – Preparing for training (24 August)
Key message: “Read advice from past trainees”
Notes: This was the strongest-performing email with the highest open and click rates.

- Email 2 – Preparing for placement (26 August / 14 September)
Key message: “What to expect from your mentor”
Notes: Moderate engagement; practical placement content performed better than mentor-focused material.

- Email 3 – Behaviour management (14 / 21 September)
Key message: “Manage pupil behaviour and plan lessons”
Notes: Notable drop in engagement.

- Email 4 – Support during training (28 September)
Key message: “Struggling with training? Get support!”
Notes: Lower reach but the ‘problem-framing’ approach produced stronger subject line results.

## Key findings

### Timing matters

Engagement was highest before training started. Email 1, sent in late August, achieved the best open (23–25%) and click (6–7%) rates. Later emails in September saw lower engagement, which may reflect reduced availability once trainees began their courses or differences in when key training milestones occurred.

### Subject line learnings

Most A/B tests showed small differences (0.3–0.6pp). However, problem-framing worked best — for example, “Struggling with teacher training?” outperformed neutral alternatives in Email 4.

### SCITT vs University audiences

SCITT trainees were slightly more engaged (higher opens/clicks), though University lists were larger and delivered more total interactions.

### CTA behaviour

The first call-to-action button consistently outperformed secondary ones, suggesting visual hierarchy and placement were more influential than copy alone.

### Content performance

- High interest: preparation and first placement topics
- Moderate: behaviour management
- Low: mentor-focused content
- Emerging: support and wellbeing content showed renewed interest later in the campaign, suggesting trainees may seek this kind of guidance once settled into training.

### Surveys

Two survey emails were sent alongside early campaigns. Response rates were 5% before term started and 2% once term began, showing it was far easier to engage trainees before training began. Future surveys were paused as a result.

## What trainees did next

Email-driven traffic accounted for 68% of all site visits. 61% of users were on mobile devices. Bounce rates were high (59%), and median session length was 1–2 seconds — suggesting trainees scanned quickly for key information rather than browsing widely.

### Top pages viewed

- Preparing for training
- Preparing for first placement
- Advice from former trainees

These pages were also rated most positively in the site’s “Is this page useful?” feedback component.

## What we learned

- Engagement declined over time — possibly due to timing or changing trainee priorities once courses started. Future campaigns could explore aligning messages with key academic points, such as placement starts or increased workload periods.
- Content timing is crucial — early communication (pre-term) performs best.
- Pain-point framing works — subject lines acknowledging trainee struggles increase engagement.
- CTA hierarchy matters — position and prominence drive clicks.
- Mobile-first design is essential given most trainees read emails on phones.

## Recommendations

- Share content earlier in the trainee journey — ideally right after course acceptance.
- Test bolder subject line contrasts and different delivery timings (weekday mornings).
- Optimise landing pages with concise summaries, visuals, and clear CTAs.
- Focus content on practical, high-value topics: preparation, placement, behaviour, and support.
- Explore alternative engagement formats (events, communities, or integrated services) to reduce reliance on repeated campaigns.

## Next steps

- Integrate Get ready to teach with upstream services such as Get into Teaching and Apply for teacher training to form a joined-up user journey.
- Add more personalised and dynamic content for future cohorts.
- Continue testing subject lines, timings, and formats to refine what works best.
