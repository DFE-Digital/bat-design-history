We needed to define exactly which users we would be targeting as part of our private beta.

This needed to:

- only be a sample of our user group as a whole
- align with previous research and departmental priorities

## Choosing users starting training in the 2025/26 academic year

We will be launching the service to those starting teacher training in the 2025/26 academic year. This will include those training:

- in a secondary subject
- on a provider-led postgraduate teacher training course

This aligns with departmental priorities around recruiting teachers into secondary subjects.

Previous research also showed that trainees on provider-led postgraduate teacher training had:

- one of the lowest experience scores
- one of the highest dropout rates
- the largest cohort of trainees

We will only contact an initial sample of around 9,000 trainees (around 30% of all trainees).

As this cohort progresses into early career teachers, we will continue to contact this same sample for comparison purposes.

## Contacting users starting training in the 2026/27 academic year

Trainees for the 2026 to 2027 academic year can start to apply for places on a teacher training course from October 2025.

We plan to contact them from January 2026, sending them preparatory content to help them feel more prepared for teacher training.

We will expand this cohort to both primary and secondary trainees on provider-led postgraduate teacher training routes.

## Further considerations

We want to do further research into other routes into teacher training, including:

- School Direct salaried
- Provider-led undergraduate training
- High potential initial teacher training (HPITT)
- Postgraduate teacher apprenticeships (PGTA)
- Teacher degree apprenticeships (TDA)

This will likely be for trainees starting in the 2027 to 2028 academic year.
