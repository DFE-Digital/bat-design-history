The Teacher Success team was formed in January 2025 and picked up work started by a squad working on the Register Trainee Teachers service who were investigating trainee dropouts. 

This meant that several rounds of research exploring the trainee problem space had been done.  

The DfE had yet to build a service dedicated to trainees, but several adjacent services had identified trainee, and candidate needs relevant to this area. 

Therefore, we started the project with an evidence review, to inform what we already knew and what we still needed to find out in this next phase. 

The included insight from: 

- Get Ready to Teach (preceding team) 

- Get into Teaching 

- Find a Postgraduate Training Course 

- Apply for Initial Teacher Training 

- Manage School Placements  

- Continuing Professional Development 

## Using AI to help us find themes from unexplored feedback 

We found that a survey completed by over 3000 trainees had a large number of open responses that the previous team had not had time to analyse. 

We anonymised and cleaned the data and then worked with Microsoft’s AI tool, (Co-pilot) to theme the responses. 

We combined this fresh insight alongside insights drawn from previous research to give us a steer on what challenges trainees face during training.  

## Key themes from the review 

### High workload 

Users reported overwhelming workloads because of the timings and volume of assignments, evidence gathering and lesson planning. 

Mentoring issues  

Some users didn’t feel adequately supported by mentors in school or in training due to poor mentor fit or lack of mentor capacity.  

Financial issues 

Others felt lack of financial support made training difficult. 

Course content timing and relevance issues 

Some users felt the timing and content of their training did not adequately prepare them for teaching on placement. 

Placement quality and experience issues 

Some users had poor placement experiences due to one or more of the following: 

poor fit 

a mismatch in expectations between themselves and the school 

the location of their placement 

Metal health and wellbeing issues 

As a result of the above, some users had poor mental health and wellbeing, particularly because of high workloads. Not all felt adequately supported when they felt overwhelmed. 

Despite the existing evidence we still had gaps 

While this evidence was extremely insightful, there were gaps in our depth of understanding about why certain problems occurred.  

This is because much of the insight was derived from quantitative surveys, so while it was clear workload was a key issue, we were not confident why workload issues occurred and what we might do about it. 

We decided to run a small round of mop-up discovery research to ensure we could effectively ideate solutions to the problem.
