The Get ready to teach squad led user research and analysis in 2024 to understand why around 10% of trainee teachers withdraw from training before achieving Qualified teacher status (QTS). This led to the creation of a dedicated Teacher Success team, tasked with building a support hub for trainee teachers.  

The work of this team has been guided by the service vision:

>Our service aims to improve ITT outcomes both for trainees and the education sector, increasing the number who achieve qualified teacher status and progress into rewarding teaching careers

This vision was developed collaboratively by the team and aimed to ensure we are not just getting as many trainees qualified as possible. Instead, our aim was to prioritise capabilities that would leave trainees ready and empowered for a successful career.  

## How we classified problem themes

Surveys undertaken by the Get ready to teach squad in 2024 received 3,814 responses from recently qualified teachers, with a sample of responses manually classified around key problem areas. This was supplemented in 2025 by the Teacher Success User Researcher who used Microsoft Copilot AI to classify all free text responses from the same survey.

Problem themes were consistent across both analyses:

- information and expectation setting up front and throughout training
- managing workload, especially around evidencing QTS and PGCE assignments
- gaps in support, such as from peers and mentors

## Creating features that address problem themes

Team vision workshops and a cross-division hack day captured ideas for digital enablers and interventions that could help trainees in problem areas. These ranged from a standard QTS evidencing tool and a helpline, to a digital peer network and support events. We plotted them on a matrix of impact vs effort and developed and tested hypotheses against the most compelling options in qualitative user research with trainees.  

The result was, whilst a lot of trainees experience the problems we had previously classified, not everyone experiences all of them and trainees may experience them at different times. This made it difficult to scope a minimum viable product (MVP) with universal day one appeal and made us realise that we needed far more granular data on when trainees experience problems and how that might correlate to their training setting or circumstances. With research suggesting that policy change may be needed to deliver the best outcomes, we were also reluctant to place too much expectation on a digital service alone.  

## A lean MVP approach

We decided to prioritise expectation setting and support as the problem themes to address for our MVP and to rely on signposting existing resources in the latter instance.

Our rationale was:

1. We could deliver a basic website hosting advisory articles at low cost in time for the 25/26 academic year, and drive traffic to specific articles by email at the right time.  
2. We will learn from engagement with those articles the things that are on the minds of trainees in different settings over time and use that to inform our roadmap.
3. The same engagement generates insight that can be surfaced to DfE policy teams and providers to provide time-based analysis of problem areas and potentially inform policy change.

This approach will deliver a service into private beta that is a very small subset of the service we ultimately imagine. It is designed as a platform for learning what is needed over time, rather than a complete solution. This is therefore a product-led approach, where the user engagement with the service informs service evolution.  

Our service strategy relies heavily on content becoming increasingly context specific for each user.

A login will be introduced once our private beta cohort are registered with DfE and have a Teacher reference number (TRN). Once that login is in place, our analytics will be increasingly attributable to individuals, leading to a personalised service for individual trainees.
