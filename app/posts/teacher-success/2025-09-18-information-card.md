## What we did

In some previous rounds of research we found that some important resources were being missed by trainees. Feedback suggested the page could feel dense, and useful links were getting lost within long text sections.

To help trainees notice and engage with this material, we introduced an information card component. This pattern was adapted from the Early years child development training service <https://child-development-training.education.gov.uk/> where it had been used successfully to highlight key learning points.

## Purpose of the component

- Draw attention to high-value resources within longer content.
- Provide a clear, scannable signpost so users know something is important.
- Create consistency with other DfE services by reusing an established pattern.

## Whatâ€™s next

We will monitor:

- Analytics: click-through rates from the card compared with surrounding links.
- Feedback: whether trainees report finding resources more easily.
- Consistency: opportunities to use the information card across other areas of Get ready to teach.
