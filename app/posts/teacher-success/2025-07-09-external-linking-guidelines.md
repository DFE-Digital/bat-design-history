There are resources from third party organisations that are useful tools for trainees to use during their teacher training.

The service does not plan to create its own resources due to:

- capacity – recreating Department for Education approved resources on all the topics trainees cover (for example, lesson planning and behaviour management) would be a mass undertaking and require significant resource to replace what is already there
- impartiality – many teachers and trainees join unions or receive support from third party organisations, which the department is not in a position to provide in an impartial capacity
- expertise – the service does not have the required expertise or authority to create these resources and as an administrative department, we are not a brand that people look to for this kind of expertise

## Framework

The service will link to external, third-party organisations where one or more of the following applies:

- the department currently funds or has provided funding for the organisation in the past
- the organisation is a non-departmental public body
- the department has an existing relationship with the organisation, for example, is in partnership with or sponsors the organisation
- the organisation is a charitable or not-for-profit organisation

The service will review its links quarterely to ensure:

- the service is still adhering to this external linking guidance
- the links are still accurate
- the links are still relevant
- there are no organisations within GOV.UK that now meet the need better

### Linking internally

The service will aim to link to content on GOV.UK where possible and where there is relevant and accurate information for our audiences.

### Linking to not-for-profit or charitable organisations

The service will link to third party organisations where the organisation is charitable or not-for profit and the content is accurate, relevant and cannot be sourced on internal websites such as GOV.UK.

### Linking to commercial websites

The service will avoid linking to commercial organisations where possible, unless there is an established partnership between that organisation and the department.

The service may link to a commercial organisation if there is a significant or obvious need fulfilled by that organisation.

The service would then aim to link to a range of other organisations to avoid promoting one singular commercial organisation and will clear through relevant policy teams. In cases where other organisations that meet the criteria are not available, the service may in that instance only provide a link to one single organisation.

## Disclaimer when linking to external organisations

The below disclaimer should be used when the service shares links to any external organisation, including charities, not-for-profit organisations or commercial websites.

‘Department for Education is not responsible for the content of any resources linked to outside of GOV.UK. Any external links provided are only ever examples of external resources trainees may want to use. Trainees should always refer to the specific advice of their training provider first.’

## Example organisations the service will link to
