A key outcome from the research conducted in March 2024 (“[Understanding trainee withdrawals](/register-trainee-teachers/understanding-trainee-withdrawals/)” research and data analysis) was that the way we collect data about the reasons trainees are withdrawing from initial teacher training (ITT) is not specific enough for DfE to create measurable interventions to help improve retention.

There are many options providers are given to select for trainee withdrawal:

- Written off after a lapse of time
- Does not want to become a teacher
- Could not give enough time
- Teaching placement problems
- Stopped responding to messages
- Transferred to another provider
- Unhappy with course provider or employing school
- Financial problems
- Problems with their health
- Did not meet entry requirements
- Got a job
- Did not make progress
- Did not pass the assessment
- Course was not suitable
- Did not pass exams
- Personal reasons
- Unacceptable behaviour
- Family problems
- Another reason

However, the most common withdrawal reasons for trainee withdrawal lack the specificity to create meaningful interventions.

For example, in the 2022 to 2023 academic year, out of 2858 withdrawals entered into Register trainee teachers (Register):

- 53% were for “another reason”
- 14% were for “personal reasons”
- 7% were for “unknown” reasons

This means 74% of withdrawals make it hard to make evidence-based interventions which can have measurable impacts.

This reflects a continuation of a trend from previous academic years:

| | 2020 to 2021 | 2021 to 2022 | 2022 to 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Another reason | 27% | 25% | 53% |
| Personal reasons | 31% | 31% | 14% |
| Unknown | 14% | 15% | 7% |
| **Total** | 72% | 72% | 74% |

The current process allows the provider to enter more details as free text. We found this field helpful in clarifying the reason for the withdrawal, but the free-text reasons were primarily provided in the options.

## We spoke with providers and ran a trainee survey

We conducted face-to-face interviews with 6 school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) providers and 8 higher education institutions (HEI) ITT providers. We received 649 responses from a survey sent to trainees who had recently withdrawn.

We identified significant differences between the responses. Providers mentioned “poor trainee performance” and “financial reasons” as the most common reasons trainees gave for withdrawal. The trainee survey revealed that workload, mental health issues, and issues with their placement school were the most common.

The difference could be because:

- the reasons for withdrawal are complicated, multifaceted and hard to describe
- the person who is responsible for recording the reason in Register does not know the reason
- the reason is not being passed to the provider
- the provider or the trainee could feel pressurised to give socially desirable reasons

## We continued research with trainees

We interviewed trainees about their withdrawal experiences and sent a survey to post-QTS trainees to gain a more thorough understanding of the training experience.

We defined 20 specific recommendations for interventions based on the research and assigned each an impact and effort assessment.

The obvious and necessary outcome of this task was to improve the withdrawal user journey. Ensuring more accurate and complete data on the reasons for withdrawal at the point of withdrawal will allow us to measure any interventions we employ more precisely.

## Understand the situation of the withdrawal

Knowing the situation of the trainee withdrawal would help ensure that the data we collect about the reasons for trainee withdrawal is accurate and complete.

For example, was something happening in the trainee’s life that meant they could not complete the course, or was the withdrawal a result of a discussion leading to the provider judging that the trainee would not complete the course?

## We created a prototype and tested the question flow

An additional question and answer set would clarify the reasons for withdrawal. We proposed the following questions and answers:

Why are you withdrawing the trainee?

- We had to withdraw the trainee
- Lack of progress led to the trainee withdrawing
- The trainee withdrew for other reasons

We also made the following changes to the withdrawal journey:

- We refined the withdrawal reasons to align with the situation (such as combining financial and mental health reasons into one ‘personal reasons’)

- We removed “Unknown” as a choice to ensure a recognised reason is chosen

- We added “Another reason” as an option, which opened a free-text field for the reason to be included. We let the provider know we may contact them to discuss the issue

- We included a question to know if the trainee would consider returning

We sent the questions, asked providers to follow withdrawal scenarios with the new withdrawal reasons, and received 150 responses.

The new format performed well, but we noted some recommendations:

- Soften the language such as ‘failure’ to ‘lack of progress’ and stress that withdrawal is always at the end of a long process of discussion with the trainee.

- Inform the provider that any answers would help DfE better understand withdrawal reasons and inform policy to increase trainee retention.

- Many comments related to the initial three questions, so we decided to simplify them to two:

  Why are you withdrawing the trainee?

  - We had to withdraw the trainee
  - The trainee chose to withdraw

  This allows any nuance about whether they were advised or not to be determined in the subsequent questions.

The new withdrawal journey went live on 13 February 2025.
