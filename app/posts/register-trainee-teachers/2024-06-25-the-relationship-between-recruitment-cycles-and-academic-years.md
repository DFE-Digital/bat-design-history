Postgraduate teacher training has:

- recruitment cycles - when candidates are recruited
- academic years - when recruited candidates become trainees and undertake their training

A recruitment cycle precedes an academic year. For example, recruitment cycle 2023 to 2024 recruits trainees for the academic year 2024 to 2025.

## Recruitment cycles

Postgraduate teacher training follows a ‘recruitment cycle’ from October to September.

All training providers must follow the recruitment cycle dates. This applies even if they do not use Publish teacher training courses (Publish) and Manage teacher training applications (Manage).

A recruitment cycle has several important dates. For example, for the 2024 to 2025 recruitment cycle:

|Date and time|What happens|
| --- | --- |
|1 October 2024 at 9&nbsp;am |Candidates can find courses for the 2024 to 2025 recruitment cycle on GOV.UK.|
|8 October 2024 at 9&nbsp;am |Start of 2024 to 2025 recruitment cycle. Candidates can apply for courses.|
|16 September 2025 at 6&nbsp;pm |The last day for candidates to apply for courses.|
|24 September 2025 at 11:59&nbsp;pm |End of 2024 to 2025 recruitment cycle. Applications awaiting decisions are rejected.|

### Rollover

Rollover is a period of time towards the end of a recruitment cycle where we copy ‘open’ and ‘closed’ courses from the current recruitment cycle into the new recruitment cycle so that training providers can begin preparing for the next recruitment cycle.

The rollover period typically runs from July until Find postgraduate teacher training (Find) opens in October.

## Academic years

Academic years are determined by the course start date.

|If the course starts between:|The academic year is:|

|1 August 2023 to 31 July 2024|2023 to 2024|
|1 August 2022 to 31 July 2023|2022 to 2023|

For most students, each academic year runs from 1 September to 31 August, but there are 4 official start dates in each academic year, each lasting 12 months.

For postgraduate teaching apprenticeships (PGTA), the academic year may start as early as 1 June.
