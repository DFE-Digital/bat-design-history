The language used to describe organisations in the initial teacher training (ITT) ecosystem has changed over the years. This post explains the changes and why we made them.

## Background

Previously, we used the term 'lead school' to refer to a single school within a group of schools. The lead school was designated as the 'lead' and would complete paperwork, submit returns, and take on the administrative burden for the group.

## The 2023 to 2024 reforms

In the 2023 to 2024 academic year, there was a series of reforms in the ITT space. These led to changes in policy, standards and accreditations of ITT providers. Some providers lost their accreditation as a result of these reforms.

Without accreditation, those providers had to seek partnerships with accredited providers to continue delivering ITT courses. At this point, providers without accreditation became known as 'lead partners'.

## The problem with 'lead partner'

The term 'lead partner' caused issues. It was not intuitive because these partners were not leading any activities. There were also no different types of partners that would require one type to be designated as the 'lead'.

Different services within the Department for Education (DfE) also used different terminology to describe these unaccredited providers, which added to the confusion.

## What we changed

We introduced a new term: 'training partner'.

This works because it:

- covers an array of provider types
- meets users' cognitive needs more widely
- needs much less explaining

The term has been adopted into policy wording and within ITT providers. It is now reflected within the Register trainee teachers service.

## Services affected

The following DfE services use this terminology:

- Register trainee teachers
- Publish teacher training courses
- Register of training providers
