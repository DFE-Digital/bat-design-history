In a previous piece of work, [Improving the withdrawals journey](/register-trainee-teachers/improving-the-withdrawals-journey), we redesigned and improved the way to collect specific reasons why people withdrew from initial teacher training (ITT) on Register trainee teachers (Register).

We used research from [Understanding trainee withdrawals](/register-trainee-teachers/understanding-trainee-withdrawals) to understand the most common withdrawal reasons for trainee withdrawal lacked the specificity to create meaningful interventions.

The new withdrawal journey went live on 13 February 2025.

We communicated this to providers through email and the January edition of the Becoming a Teacher newsletter, where we explained:

- providers should have background information to why the trainee has withdrawn to hand, before they start the withdrawal process
- that answers will help us better understand withdrawal reasons and inform policy with the aim of increasing teacher trainee retention

## How the legacy withdrawal data is managed

Withdrawal reasons data collected from Register prior 13 February 2025 will not be retrospectively filled in with the new question data fields. We have already analysed this data set.

We will start a new analysis of the data coming in from the improved withdrawal process.

## Withdrawal journey next steps

Withdrawals remain a manual process.

A bulk withdrawals tool is not a feature on the Register roadmap for the 2024 to 2025 academic year.  However, higher education institution (HEI) providers will be able to use the new Register API for withdrawals in bulk for the upcoming 2025 to 2026 academic year.

An updated withdrawals analytics dashboard in Looker Studio will help us:

- better understand the reason for withdrawals
- compare month-by-month withdrawal activity to establish where in the academic year is the peak withdrawal activity
- share findings with policy to see if thereâ€™s a way of increasing trainee retention

## Exploring the relationship between deferrals and withdrawals

Some providers have anecdotally reported that deferrals often become withdrawals.

The Register team will do further research to see if this is a valid hypothesis. We will do this by:

- calculating the percentage of deferred trainees who go on to withdraw
- accessing the Apply for teacher training (Apply) service to cross-reference trainees who have withdrawn where the application originated from Apply
- starting work on identifying improvements to the deferral journey
- understanding where we can support deferred trainees to come back and complete their teacher training
