We began work on a new prototype for the Register service in early September 2020. The [alpha prototype](/register-trainee-teachers/alpha-prototype/) was a static InVision prototype, which while good for quick iteration, limited some of the usability testing we could do. This new one is built with the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/) and allows us to test complex journeys with realistic data.

## Journey changes

Working in HTML and designing for progressive enhancement necessitated some changes from the alpha designs:

- use the task list pattern rather than tabs for each form
- break up forms across pages to support adding multiples (like multiple degrees)
- implicitly require that each section be completed as a whole, and not allow individual fields to be left blank

The new prototype borrows heavily from the Apply and Manage services. Register sits half way between them in terms of data collected and actions users need to take, so itâ€™s been incredibly helpful to have them to take inspiration from.

## Task list pattern

This pattern allows us to have multiple sections that users can complete in any order. As the Register service supports more routes, we can vary the sections shown so they are specific to each route.
