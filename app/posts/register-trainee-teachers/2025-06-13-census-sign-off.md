At the beginning of each academic year, between 1st September and 31st October, Initial Teacher Training (ITT) data must be submitted to Register trainee teachers (Register) and signed off, as the Department for Education (DfE) requires accurate data for the ITT census publication.

In previous years, this process has been completed outside of the Register service, with notifications sent to providers to complete a form, the data from which is then sent to the DfE.

Earlier this year, a similar process for completing the performance profiles sign-off was successfully streamlined by integrating it into Register. Therefore, it made sense to do the same for the census sign-off, reducing complexity for users and optimising the data collection process.


## How it works

The initial step will remain unchanged. Each year, the DfE will continue to notify providers by email that the census sign-off window is open and that they should log in to Register to confirm their new trainee numbers and complete the sign-off process.

Once logged into Register, a notification banner will appear on the home screen during the census sign-off period if no one in the organisation has signed off on the census process. This banner will inform providers that the census sign-off is due and provide a link to the reports page.

From the reports page, providers can access the census sign-off process. If someone from the organisation has already signed off the census, they will see the following message indicating that the sign-off has been completed.

> Someone in your organisation has already completed the census sign-off.

The next page offers guidance on completing the census sign-off process, including a link to further information on the [Initial Teacher Training Census methodology](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/initial-teacher-training-census). Users can then download a CSV file of the new trainees that Register currently holds for the organisation for the academic year, allowing them to check against their student records system (SRS) to ensure the numbers are accurate.

The following page is the actual sign-off page, where users can confirm that the numbers are accurate.

The census sign off summary card includes:

- provider name
- UK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN)
- currently logged-in approver's name

The checkbox must be checked in order to confirm that the trainee numbers are correct.

Once the 'Sign off census' button is pressed to complete the process, an email will be sent to all users for that provider, confirming that the process has been completed on their behalf.

The final page will show a confirmation message indicating that the census sign-off has been completed, and the user may return to the reports page.
