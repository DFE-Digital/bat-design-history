At the beginning of each academic year, between 1st September and 31st October, Initial Teacher Training (ITT) data must be submitted to Register trainee teachers (Register) and signed off as the Department for Education (DfE) requires accurate data for the ITT census publication.

In previous years, this process has been completed outside of the Register service, with notifications sent to providers to complete a form, the data from which is sent to the DfE.

Earlier this year, a similar process for completing the performance profiles sign-off was successfully streamlined by integrating it into Register. It therefore made sense to do the same for the census sign-off, easing complexity for users and optimising the data collection process.


## How it works

The initial step will remain the same. Each year DfE will continue to notify providers by email that the census sign-off window is open and that they should log in to Register to confirm their new trainee numbers and complete the sign-off process.

Once logged into Register, a notification banner will be displayed on the home screen during the census sign-off period if the census process hasn't been signed off by anyone in the organisation. This banner will inform providers that the census sign-off is due and provide a link to the reports page.

From the reports page, providers can access the census sign-off process. If someone from the organisation has already signed off the census, they will see the following message indicating that the sign-off has been completed.

> The census sign-off has already been completed by someone in your organisation.

The next page offers guidance on how to complete the census sign-off process with a link to further information on the [Initial Teacher Training Census methodology](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/initial-teacher-training-census). The user can then download a CSV file of the new trainees Register currently holds for the organisation for the current academic year so they can check against their student records system (SRS) to ensure that the numbers are correct.

The next page is the actual sign-off page, where the user can confirm that the numbers are correct. There is a summary box displaying the organisations Provider name, UK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN) and the currently logged-in approver name with a checkbox to confirm that the trainee numbers are correct. The user can then check the checkbox to confirm the details are correct. Once the 'Sign-off census' button is pressed to complete the process, an email will be sent to all users for that provider confirming that the process has been completed on their behalf.

The final page will display a confirmation message indicating that the census sign-off has been completed, and the user can return to the reports page.
