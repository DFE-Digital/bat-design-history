There are 7 routes into teaching for domestic candidates. These routes are split between undergraduate and postgraduate initial teacher training (ITT) and assessment only.

International candidates may be eligible for all these routes into teaching if they meet visa and residency requirements.

Training providers can deliver any number of routes.

[![Routes into teaching for domestic candidates](routes-into-teaching.png "Routes into teaching for domestic candidates")](routes-into-teaching.png)

Each route leads to qualified teacher status (QTS).

QTS is a legal requirement to teach in many English schools. It signifies that an individual meets all the [Teachers’ standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards) and can teach in maintained primary, secondary, and special schools in England.

Teachers trained overseas who meet the quality criteria can also apply for QTS.

## Undergraduate ITT routes

Undergraduate ITT has 2 routes:

- undergraduate initial teacher training (UGITT)
- teacher degree apprenticeship (TDA)

### Undergraduate initial teacher training (UGITT)

Undergraduate ITT is a 3 to 4-year course for trainees without a first degree. If successful, trainees will be awarded an undergraduate degree and QTS.

### Teacher degree apprenticeship (TDA)

Teacher degree apprenticeship is a new route to becoming a teacher, where successful candidates can earn while they learn and gain an undergraduate degree and QTS while working in school.

## Postgraduate ITT routes

Postgraduate ITT has 4 routes:

- fee-funded initial teacher training
- school direct salaried (SDS)
- postgraduate teacher apprenticeship (PGTA)
- high potential initial teacher training (HPITT)

Except for the assessment-only route, all postgraduate ITT routes often include a postgraduate certificate of education (PGCE)  or professional graduate diploma in education (PGDE) alongside QTS.

A PGCE is an internationally recognised academic qualification.

### Fee-funded initial teacher training

Fee-funded ITT accounts for most ITT courses and is for applicants already with a degree. In most circumstances, trainees study for 9 months and pay tuition fees. [Significant financial incentives are available in some subjects](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2023-to-2024).

### School direct salaried (SDS)

The ‘school direct salaried’ route allows candidates to learn ‘on the job’ and earn an unqualified teacher’s salary while they train towards QTS over one academic year (9 months). It’s an employment-based route for high-quality graduates.

### Postgraduate teacher apprenticeship (PGTA)

The postgraduate teacher apprenticeship route allows candidates to learn ‘on the job’ and earn an unqualified teacher’s salary while training towards QTS for one full calendar year (12 months). It’s an employment-based route that requires apprentices to complete an end-point assessment (EPA) to consolidate learning from initial teacher training.

### High potential initial teacher training (HPITT)

The high-potential ITT route is a national 2-year employment-based initial teacher training and leadership development programme that seeks to recruit and train high-potential graduates and career changers who would be otherwise unlikely to join the profession or work in a school serving an area of greatest need.​

[Teach First](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/) delivers the current HPITT contract and covers cohorts up to and including the ITT2025 cohort (academic year 2025 to 2026).

## Assessment only (AO)

Assessment only is a route to QTS for teaching staff who already meet the teachers’ standards, have the requisite teaching experience, and do not need further training. AO entails a series of assessments over 12 weeks to show how candidates meet the teachers’ standards.
