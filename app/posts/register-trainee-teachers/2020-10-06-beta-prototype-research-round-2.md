Our intention in the second round of research was to answer the following questions:

* Are there any other needs specific to the provider-led postgraduate route?
* What are our users key behaviours and needs around data collection and input? 
* What are the needs around inputting large numbers of trainees?
* How do users handle alternative assessment outcomes to a QTS recommendation?
* Do our users want to manage data on individual or on cohort basis and how is a cohort characterised?
* What is understood about “allocations”?
* What are their habits around updating records due to withdrawals and deferrals? 

## Who we tested with

* Associated Merseyside Partnership (AMP) SCITT
* Essex Primary SCITT
* Partnership London SCITT
* Suffolk & Norfolk SCITT
* The Pimlico London SCITT
* University College Birmingham
