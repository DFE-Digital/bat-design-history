To prepare Register trainee teachers (Register) for the changes brought by initial teacher training (ITT) reforms, we needed to update training routes and organisations. These changes will be in place for the beginning of the 2024 to 2025 academic year.

## Changes to training routes

2 training routes have been removed:

- School&#8209;direct (fee&#8209;funded)
- School&#8209;direct (salaried)

2 training routes have been added:

- Early years postgraduate salaried
- Provider&#8209;led postgraduate salaried

As part of the changes, we added headings to the route selection screen.

Before:

After:

## Changes to organisations

From 1&nbsp;August&nbsp;2024, some higher education institutions (HEI) and school&#8209;centred initial teacher training (SCITT) will lose their accredited status. Of these, some will form partnerships with providers who retained their accreditation and will become ‘lead&nbsp;partners’.

Organisations that were ‘lead&nbsp;schools’, will now also be known as ‘lead&nbsp;partners’.

This introduces 2 types of organisation to Register:

1. Providers who lost their accreditation and stopped all training
2. Providers who lost their accreditation and have become lead partners

Both these new types of organisation will need to be:

- prevented from creating new trainees
- able to view and edit trainees who started before the 2024 to 2025 academic year (edit access is removed from all trainees once teacher status has been awarded)

Providers who become lead partners will need to have read&#8209;only access for trainees where they are the lead partner.

| Organisation type before 1&nbsp;August&nbsp;2024 | Organisation type after 1&nbsp;August&nbsp;2024 | Trainees who started before 1&nbsp;August&nbsp;2024 | Trainees who started after 1&nbsp;August&nbsp;2024 |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Accredited provider | Accredited provider | Read&#8209;write | Read&#8209;write |
| Accredited provider | Lead partner        | Read&#8209;write | Read&#8209;only  |
| Accredited provider | Stoped training     | Read&#8209;write | None             |
| Lead school         | Lead partner        | Read&#8209;only  | Read&#8209;only  |

### Adding and updating trainee records through the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA)

Because the HESA data does not allow for the notion of ‘accredited&nbsp;provider’ or ‘lead&nbsp;partner’, lead&nbsp;partners will be permitted to use their student record system and HESA to submit records.

When a lead&nbsp;partner uses HESA to submit data, Register will automatically assign those trainee records to the accredited&nbsp;provider the lead&nbsp;partner works with.
