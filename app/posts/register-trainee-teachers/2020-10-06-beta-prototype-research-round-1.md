Our intention in this first round of research was to answer the following questions:

* Can users navigate through the service successfully?
* Are we meeting the user needs for the Assessment Only route?
* Are we requesting the right data, relevant to the Assessment Only route?

## Who we tested with

* University of Winchester
* University of East London
* University of Southampton
* Essex & Thames SCITT
* Surrey South Farnham SCITT
