Organisations involved in initial teacher training (ITT) have the flexibility to form partnerships in which they share knowledge, experience, and resources to support delivery and help retain existing talent and expertise in the sector.

## Partnerships

Partnerships are based on a formal agreement.

Each partnership arrangement is unique to the organisations involved, their local or regional circumstances, and their ultimate aims and ambitions over time.

Partnerships can take various forms, from simple collaborations between two or three
organisations, to more extensive networks with multiple partners.

Partnerships can form between:

- accredited ITT providers
- lead partners
- placement schools

### Accredited ITT providers

An accredited ITT provider is also known as a:

- accredited provider
- accredited entity
- legal entity

An accredited ITT provider is a legal entity accredited by DfE that delivers teacher training that leads to qualified teacher status (QTS).

The accredited ITT provider has been awarded accreditation and has full and final accountability for all aspects of training design, delivery, and quality across the partnership. It is liable for the quality of provision, governance, and internal controls. It will be accountable and responsible for public funds spent on the purposes intended across its ITT partnership.

### Lead partners

A lead partner is also known as a:

- lead delivery partner
- delivery partner
- training partner
- strategic partner
- teaching school hub partner

Lead partners work within the ITT partnership and have a partnership agreement with the accredited ITT provider.

Lead partners may be higher education institutes (HEIs), schools, trusts or other types of organisations (including Teaching School Hubs) with the capacity and expertise to take on significant operational or strategic roles in the ITT partnership.

Lead partners work in collaboration with their accredited ITT provider, and their roles could include:

- trainee recruitment
- delivering ITT courses
- contributing to curriculum design
- designing and delivering mentor curriculums
- supplying lead mentors
- running intensive training and practice (ITP)
- quality assurance of aspects such as mentoring

Lead partners may have multiple roles. Their responsibilities are agreed upon and
delegated through formal arrangements with the accredited ITT provider.

From September 2024, all Teaching School Hubs operating as lead partners will be
expected to deliver ITT courses. Teaching School Hubs may also undertake other operational or strategic roles as a lead partner - for example, those listed above.

### Placement schools

A placement school is also known as a:

- school partner
- placement partner

Schools provide high-quality general school placements for ITT trainees and supply mentors.

Placement schools or other school partners may have the capacity and expertise to offer the ITT partnershipâ€™s school-based Intensive Training and Practice (ITP) element.

School placements and other training may occur in special schools, alternative provision, pupil referral units, and mainstream schools with SEN resource units, mainly where an accredited ITT provider offers additional specialism in special educational needs.

## Accredited provider delegation and accountability

Accredited ITT providers can delegate responsibilities to their lead partners as long as they have sufficient oversight.

All organisations in a partnership may be involved in developing the ITT programme, and, in some cases, the accredited ITT provider may wish to delegate aspects of their course design to lead partners.

The accredited ITT provider ultimately holds responsibility for all elements of the course.
