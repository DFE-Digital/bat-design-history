Over the last 18 months, we have designed, tested, and developed two new features to facilitate initial teacher training (ITT) providers, which are higher education institutions (HEIs), in submitting trainee data directly into the Register trainee teachers (Register) service instead of via the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).

The first is an application programming interface (API), which enables providers to integrate their own software systems directly with Register.

The second is a comma-separated values (CSV) based import tool for adding trainees to Register, designed to be used by those providers who will not have an API solution in place yet.

These changes mean that HEI providers have had to adapt to both new systems and processes to fulfil their reporting obligations.  To support providers during this change, we developed and implemented a range of communications and support measures to minimise disruption and ensure successful uptake of the new features.

## Why we made the change

Rationale for this change is outlined in [collecting all trainee data directly from providers](/register-trainee-teachers/collecting-all-trainee-data-directly-from-providers/).

The scale of these changes meant that it was necessary to develop several support activities to help HEI providers adapt.

## What we did

Over the year leading up to the changeover, we ran quarterly webinars updating all affected providers on progress developing the new features that they would have to use, and how their processes would have to change to accommodate them. Each webinar was one hour long and consisted of a presentation by the Register team followed by a question-and-answer session.

We ran 6 rounds of user testing with the providers, including interviews, workshops and prototype usability testing. These sessions helped providers get more familiar with the upcoming changes, as well as informing the design and refinement of the features themselves.

We ran two rounds of ‘readiness surveys’ to gauge how prepared providers were in the run-up to go-live and identify which providers might need additional support during the transition. These surveys also allowed us to determine which HEI providers used which, dependent on 3rd part software vendors to help them integrate with these features.

We ran individual sessions with the organisations that provide student record systems to HEI providers, to help them develop their systems to integrate with the new features. These sessions are running at least once a month with each organisation, but more frequently as required.

As soon as features were functional, we allowed providers and vendors to test them in dedicated sandbox environments, allowing them to test how well they worked with the complex ecosystems of hardware and software that HEIs use.

In the month before and two months after go-live (August to October 2025), we ran drop-in sessions fortnightly, where we made key product, design and technical staff available to answer questions and troubleshoot participants’ problems.

## Opportunities

Running this broad range of activities with providers and the vendors who support them not only helped providers transition to the new features but also allowed us to gather a deep understanding of our users, how they work and how best to plan similar changes in the future.

## Challenges

This broad approach to provider engagement had two significant challenges:

1. In a practical sense, this requires a lot of team resources to develop and run the various activities.

2. Ensuring that the right provider staff were engaged with the various activities was not straightforward. HEIs are large organisations with responsibilities relating to trainee teachers spread across teams and departments, so initially communications did not always go to the right people, and we had to work closely with providers to ensure we understood who should be involved in which activities.

## Next steps

The service has gone live, so we need to continue running drop-in sessions while closely monitoring feature dashboards to ensure providers are both engaged and successful in using the new features.
