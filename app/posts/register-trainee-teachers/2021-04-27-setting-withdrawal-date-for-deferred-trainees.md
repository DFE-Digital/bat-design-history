If a trainee defers from their course and then withdraws, providers are meant to use the trainee’s deferral date as their withdrawal date - as this is the date they were last on the course.

Previously our withdrawal page asked for a withdrawal date - but if the trainee is already deferred we don’t want providers to have a choice of date. Instead we’ll tell the provider that we’ll use the existing deferral date as the withdrawal date.

Our previous withdrawal date question:

New alternative withdrawal date question:

The deferral date is shown on the confirmation page, but cannot be changed.
