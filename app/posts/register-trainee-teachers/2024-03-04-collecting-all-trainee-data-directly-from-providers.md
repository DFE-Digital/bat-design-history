# Collecting all trainee data directly from providers



We have decided to collect all trainee data directly from initial teacher training (ITT) providers for the academic year 2025/2026.

## Background

Currently, we collect data about trainees differently depending on type of provider.

School Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT) providers submit directly to the Register service, however Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) submit data for most of their trainees via Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), who in turn hand it on to Register.

In 2023 we reviewed this process by examining historic reasons for this way of working and talking to a wide range of internal and external stakeholders. Having collected feedback from internal stakeholders, training providers and student record system vendors we weighed the potential benefits of changing the process to consolidate all trainee data collection to direct submission into register.

## Consolidating data collection

Based on this analysis we have decided to move HEIs to submit all their trainee teacher data directly to Register for the following reasons:

- we have a strategic priority to bring all teacher recruitment services in-house and to consolidate how we collect data across our service line

- we’ll have the opportunity to access the data in a more timely way to inform our decision-making

- we’ll have more frequent communications with you directly to make sure you understand the reasons we collect data and that you’re happy with the requests we’re making

## How we will do it

From the 2025/26 collection cycle, HEIs will be able to:

- submit data directly to the Register service through an API (a piece of software)

- bulk upload a CSV file to Register

- manually  input data into Register

They will be able to use any combination of these options to allow for the various types of trainees and data that have to be submitted across the academic year.

We have called this ‘Send trainee data direct’.

In order to minimise disruptions and ensure all providers are ready for the changes we will be working closely with both HEIs and the student record system vendors who will integrate with the new API.  This work will include regular updates with everyone who could be impacted by these changes, extensive user research, and iterative testing of all three options.
