[The initial teacher training (ITT) market review report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-itt-market-review-report) was published in July&nbsp;2021. After public consultation, the DfE published their [response to the ITT market review](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/initial-teacher-training-itt-market-review) in December&nbsp;2021.

The recommendations which need to be followed from the 2024/25 academic year onwards, include requirements for:

- mentors to train take part in 20 hours of initial training and 6 hours of top-up training in subsequent years
- ITT providers to have lead mentors or a lead mentorship team
- trainees to take part in ’Intensive training and practice’ sessions (4 weeks for postgraduate courses and 6 weeks for undergraduate courses)

## ITT reform funding

To support providers and schools in meeting the new requirements the DfE is making grant funding available.

For schools the funding is to help cover the cost of classroom cover while mentors train. In the 2024 to 2025 school year general mentors will need to complete 20&nbsp;hours of initial mentor training. In subsequent years general mentors who have completed the 20&nbsp;hours will need 6&nbsp;hours of training.

## Prototype

One of the streams of work for the mentoring team is looking into how the grants will be distributed.

We plan to distribute the funding for ITT providers through DfE’s normal business processes.

Because the general mentor training grant is available to more than 20,000&nbsp;schools and we need specific information for each claim, a digital form is necessary to collect the data.

To test our questions and assumptions about how the service will work, we built a guidance page and a form (in Google forms).

### Guidance

![GOV.UK page with summary of ITT general mentor training grant](general-mentor-training-grant-guidance.png "Apply for ITT general mentor training funding")

### Claim form

![Google form asking user for their email address](google-form/01-email-address.png "Claim form — email address")

![Google form asking user for the URN of their school](google-form/02-school.png "Claim form — school unique reference number (URN)")

![Google form asking user for number of mentors, hours of classroom cover needed, and hours of classroom cover paid for by the provider](google-form/03-mentors.png "Claim form — number of mentors and training time")

![Google form asking user if each mentor trained at least one trainee](google-form/04-declaration.png "Claim form — each mentor trained at least one trainee")

![Google form confirmation the form has been completed](google-form/05-confirmation.png "Claim form — confirmation")

### Information required for a claim

#### School details

So we know who is making the claim and who to pay.

The amount of funding available is adjusted for location. To pay the correct amount DfE will need to know where the school is.

| **Location** | **Amount** |
|:-----:|:-----:|
| Inner London | £1072 |
| Outer London | £965 |
| Fringe | £902 |
| Rest of England | £876 |

This also allows us to check compliance using data from [Register trainee teachers](https://www.register-trainee-teachers.service.gov.uk/) (Register). Schools can only claim for mentors who mentor at least one trainee each. Assuming Register collects placement data by the end of the 2024 to 2025 academic year then we can verify that the school has not claimed for more teachers than it is eligible to.

#### Number of general mentors

This is a basic check on the claim. Schools can claim a maximum of 20&nbsp;hours per trainee. It would also help the DfE get an understanding of how many general mentors there are.

#### Hours of classroom cover so the mentor could train

The aim of the grant is to help schools pay for cover so the mentor isn’t compelled to train out of school hours.

To simplify the grant, schools are claiming for hours of classroom cover. Rather than specifying the costs that may have been incurred.

#### Hours of classroom cover paid for by 

To prevent paying schools for something already paid for, the DfE wants to deduct any hours of classroom cover paid for by the ITT provider.

The form could ask for ‘hours of backfill not paid for by the provider’. Our assumption is that it's easier to ask for the cover and the cover paid for by the provider separately instead of asking the user to make the calculation.

#### Declaration that each mentor mentored at least one trainee each

Funding is only available to mentors who mentored a trainee in the 2024 to 2025 academic year. The minimum ratio of trainees to mentors is 1:1. For example, if a trainee had 2 mentors and neither of those mentors mentored another trainee, then the school could only claim for one of those mentors.

#### Email address of user

So the DfE can contact the user about their claim.

### Assumptions and questions to test

The main things we wanted to understand were:

- participants’ reaction to new training requirement, the impact that would have and how the funding was perceived

- school’s use of cover and anticipated costs

- participants’ understanding and reaction to the rules of the funding

- what funding placement schools get from providers and if this is specifically for time when the trainee

- how participants would expect to be made aware of their entitlement to claim this funding

- their ability to get hold of the data needed to make a claim

## Summary of findings

If your email address ends ‘digital.education.gov.uk’, you can see the [analysis of the research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wcgMn0JjYUmSj801qqXHzm4kQo11QLHE5LSQjD691po/edit#slide=id.g1221b5a2b76_1_1036).

The reception to the increased training requirement was mixed. Most users saw value in improving the quality of mentoring. However, most expressed a concern that 20&nbsp;hours of training would be difficult to cover and doubted the value 20&nbsp;hours of training was likely to have, especially for experienced mentors.

Schools try to avoid using external cover where possible, so were unsure what costs they would be claiming for.

No participants said that the funding they got from providers was specifically for anything other than costs of hosting a trainee. No schools felt that the cost of hosting a trainee was covered fully by the providers they worked with.

Most participants listed a number of communications they received from the DfE as the way they’d expect to find out about the funding. Some also mentioned that they’d expect to be notified about the funding by the providers they worked with.

Providing the data required by the form was trivial.

## Next steps

We’re still working through the details of the evidence needed when making a claim. The form needs to support schools making claims for multiple providers (or at least the guidance needs to make it clear how to claim for multiple providers).
