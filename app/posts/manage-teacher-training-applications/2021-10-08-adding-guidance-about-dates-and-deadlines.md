We currently have a page of guidance about how to use the service, but it covers a lot of topics and is hard to read. It’s also out of date.

The guidance got only 49 unique views in September 2021.

We intend to remove the current guidance and replace it with a small number of short guides, each focused on a particular topic. We will include only things which we cannot easily cover within the service.

The first guide will be a table of dates and deadlines.

## What we did

We created a new ‘How to use this service’ page which will have a link to each piece of guidance.

The new guidance about dates and deadlines consists of a table telling users:

- when the recruitment cycle starts and candidates can apply for courses
- which periods are not counted as working days
- when the time to make a decision is reduced from 40 days to 20 days
- the deadline for candidates to make their first applications in the cycle
- the deadline for all applications
- when applications awaiting decisions will be automatically rejected
