We recently [added an overview page](/manage-teacher-training-applications/adding-an-overview-page-and-filters-to-help-users-prioritise-their-work/) which included coloured boxes showing the number of:

- offers with pending conditions from the previous recruitment cycle
- automatically rejected applications that need feedback

We identified some problems with these boxes. The box about offers with pending conditions:

- does not help users deal with offers made in the current recruitment cycle
- has a very long description because it has to mention the recruitment cycle

We also wanted to change the colour of the box about automatically rejected applications. We do not think that orange is the most appropriate colour for it.

## What we changed

The blue box now shows offers with pending conditions from both the current and previous cycles.

The box showing rejected applications is now red. Weâ€™ve also changed the colour of the rejected status label to match this.

We changed the declined and application withdrawn status labels from red to orange. The statuses with an orange label are now:

- conditions not met
- offer withdrawn
- declined
- application withdrawn

Only the rejected status has a red label. This helps distinguish it from the other statuses which did not end in recruitment.
