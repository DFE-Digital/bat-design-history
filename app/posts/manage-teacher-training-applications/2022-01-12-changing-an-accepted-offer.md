To change an offer after it's been accepted, users have to send an email to support with proof that the candidate agrees and details of the changes.

We do not currently tell users how to do this, which may mean that users do not:

- realise that it’s possible to change an offer after it’s been accepted
- know what they need to do in order to change an offer after it’s been accepted

We have put a message on the offer page to tell users how to change an offer after it’s been accepted.

## How it works

When the application status is ‘Conditions pending’ or ‘Recruited’ we show inset text that says:

> To change this offer, send proof that the candidate agrees and details of the changes to becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk.
