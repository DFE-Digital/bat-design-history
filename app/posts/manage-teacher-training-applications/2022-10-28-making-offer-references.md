![Illustration with the text: "Conditions of Offer: References"](conditions-of-offer-references.png)

For the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle, we [changed the references process](/apply-for-teacher-training/requesting-references-after-offers-have-been-accepted/) so that candidates do not need to receive references before they submit their application. They instead need to [give details of 2 people who can give a reference](/apply-for-teacher-training/asking-candidates-to-confirm-who-reference-requests-should-be-sent-to/).

When a provider makes a candidate an offer, we added some guidance about the new process, and how providers can let candidates know if they have any specific requirements.

This change was made on 11 October 2022, when applications could submitted for the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle and providers could start making offers.

## The issue

Research with providers showed that requirements for references varied between providers. Whilst candidates were previously only able to include 2 received references with their application, many providers were asking for additional references after the application had been submitted. These had to be requested and provided outside of the Apply and Manage digital services.


## What we changed

We added content to three existing pages.

### Conditions of offer page

![TOTO](conditions-of-offer-page.png)

We added a new References section.

In this section, we explain that candidates now confirm references to request when they accept an offer.

We also show the standard guidance that we give to candidates, which is that they need 2 references including:

* an academic tutor if they graduated in the past 5 years
* the headteacher if they’ve been working in a school

If providers have other requirements, they are told to add this as a further condition.

### Check offer page

![TODO](check-offer-page.png)

We added a single new line about references, stating that candidates are required to receive 2 references.

This line was added to reassure providers that they don’t need to add references as a separate condition unless they have different requirements.

### View offer page

![TODO](offer-page.png)

When an offer has been made, we still show the new line about references.

As before, conditions can be changed up until the point when a candidate accepts an offer.

## Other approaches we considered

We previously considered [making references a ‘standard condition’](/manage-teacher-training-applications/making-references-an-offer-condition/) using a checkbox, with a text input where providers could give details of their reference requirements.

We did usability testing on this approach and found no issues.

We have not pursued this approach for now, in part because it would need a change to the API which would then take a while to be adopted by the student record systems that many providers use.

## Future considerations

The guidance to use ‘further conditions’ to specify reference requirements is not ideal, as this will mean that candidates see references mentioned in 2 places in their offer email and the web interface after accepting an offer.

Once we’ve learnt more about how references are being used in the new process, we’d like to consider ways in which we can make this better.

This might include:

* letting providers remove the reference requirement altogether, for instance if the candidate is already employed by them and additional safeguarding checks are not required
* adding a dedicated field where providers can tell candidates their reference requirements
* allowing providers to set a deadline as a date field
* a way for providers to tell candidates that their received references have been checked and are ok, either individually or once 2 have been received
