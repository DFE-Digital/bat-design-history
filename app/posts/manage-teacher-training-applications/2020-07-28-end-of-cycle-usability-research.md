## Previous research

We know that there are specific activities providers undertake when a recruitment cycle is closing. We have already run a round of research to understand the needs behind:

* ending a recruitment cycle
* handling “edge case” applications
* planning a new cycle
* data and reporting to DfE

See the [previous entry for this research](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/end-of-cycle-exploratory-research/).

## Context

This round of research focused on the usability of designs around:

* [switching cycles](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/switching-between-cycles/)
* [retrospectively marking conditions as met for applications from the previous cycle](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/reconfirming-a-deferred-application/)
* [deferring an application](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/deferring-applications-to-the-next-cycle/)
* [confirming deferrals](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/reconfirming-a-deferred-application/)

We also looked at the new [application list task design and the activity log](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/help-users-know-what-needs-doing-and-whats-changed/)

## Approach

One to one, remote, moderated, usability testing

See the [discussion guide for more detail](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H4a3FjRK7km-S5pbWiNsO-W5yl-w5G761tkA7gA5aVs/edit#)

## Who we researched with

Provider users, typically ITT administrators or ITT Directors from:

* 2 SCITTs
* 3 Schools Direct

## Analysis

See the [Miro board analysis](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kolS1bk=/)

## New user needs identified

See the [provider user needs Trello board](https://trello.com/b/5m1pMTme/apply-provider-needs-e2e)

* Tracking conditions
  * [Track conditions across candidates](https://trello.com/c/RtcglDmF/152-track-conditions-across-candidates)

* Deferrals
  * [need candidate to accept deferred offer](https://trello.com/c/QxEUJqrY/183-i-need-to-know-if-the-candidate-has-formally-accepted-my-new-deferred-offer-so-that-i-know-they-have-agreed-to-and-accepted-the)
  * [need to confirm a deferred offer at the start of the new cycle](https://trello.com/c/r0Uq0Hug/184-given-that-courses-and-locations-do-change-i-need-to-reconfirm-a-deferred-offer-so-that-the-deferred-offer-can-be-managed-alongs)
  * [need to defer an applicant at the point of offer](https://trello.com/c/vjvuGDK3/185-i-need-to-defer-an-applicant-at-the-point-of-offer-so-that-i-can-accurately-reflect-the-offer-i-want-to-make)
