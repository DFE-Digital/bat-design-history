title: Showing partners when user permissions apply to all or none of the relationships
description: Reinstating the list of partners next to each user permission even when the permission applies to all or none of the relationships

To give users less to read, [we stopped spelling out the partners when the permissions apply to all or none of the relationships](/manage-teacher-training-applications/moving-organisational-permissions-guidance-above-the-form/#making-the-descriptions-more-concise-when-all-or-none-of-the-permissions-are-applicable).

But this was problematic because some users felt unsure who their partners were.

So weâ€™ve decided to revert back to spelling out each partner. This may also help users relate user permissions back to organisational permissions.

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [{
    text: "User details",
    img: {
      src: "user-details.png"
    }
  }, {
    text: "User permissions form",
    img: {
      src: "user-permissions-form.png"
    }
  }]
}) }}
