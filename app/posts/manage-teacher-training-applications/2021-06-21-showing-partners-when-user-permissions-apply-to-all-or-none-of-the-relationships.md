To give users less to read, we [stopped spelling out the partner organisations when the permissions apply to all or none of the relationships](/manage-teacher-training-applications/moving-organisational-permissions-guidance-above-the-form/#making-the-descriptions-more-concise-when-all-or-none-of-the-permissions-are-applicable) to give users less to read.

But research showed that some users were unsure about who their partners were.

So weâ€™ve decided to spell out each partner even if the user permissions appliy to all or none of the relationships.

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [{
    text: "User details",
    img: {
      src: "user-details.png"
    }
  }, {
    text: "User permissions form",
    img: {
      src: "user-permissions-form.png"
    }
  }]
}) }}
