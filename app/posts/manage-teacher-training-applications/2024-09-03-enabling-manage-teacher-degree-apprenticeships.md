## Background

### The problem we were trying to solve

Teacher degree apprenticeships (TDAs) are a new teacher training programme where trainees work in a school and earn a salary while getting a bachelor’s degree and qualified teacher status (QTS).

This new undergraduate route offers a way into teaching for those who do not have a degree, and may benefit user groups such as teaching assistants, school leavers or people looking to change careers.

We needed to make changes to the service to enable candidates to find and apply for TDAs, and providers to publish courses and manage applications.

## What we changed

### List of applications

We were concerned that providers may find it difficult to visually differentiate between postgraduate and undergraduate applications in Manage.

So, we added content and colour to highlight applications that were undergraduate.

### Filters

The filters in Manage did not allow for providers to view only postgraduate or undergraduate courses.

So, we added a filter to allow them to narrow down the list of applications.

### Application qualifications

TDAs do not require a degree. Those with a degree can apply if they wish, however there are more suitable postgraduate routes into teaching.

We needed to highlight this to providers when viewing applications to avoid undergraduate applications being rejected due to not having a degree.

To do this, we added content to the ‘Degree’ section of TDA applications.

## Further considerations

Once TDA applications are on Manage next cycle, further testing with providers is recommended. Testing could look at whether the new filters and visual differentiation of applications is helpful, as well as identifying further pain points that could be addressed.

## Status of this work

We prototyped changes to the service and tested with users in July 2024.

We found that the proposed changes tested well with users and decided to put the changes live.

The changes were built in August 2024, to go live for the start of the next recruitment cycle which started October 2024.
