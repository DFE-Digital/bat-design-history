We recently updated the service to [give users a way to get help through online chat](/manage-teacher-training-applications/helping-users-through-online-chat/).

We are using Zendesk to manage online chat.

We need to describe how the user’s data will be used by Department of Education and Zendesk.

## What we did

We couldn’t easily amend the current privacy policy, so we decided to add the Zendesk chat privacy notice alongside the existing policy.

## How it works

We updated the privacy policy page. We replaced the privacy policy content with links to the:

- original privacy policy content
- Zendesk chat privacy notice

## Other considerations

We considered adding a link to the chat privacy notice in the chat widget itself, but restrictions on configuration of the widget prevented us from doing so without impeding the user.
