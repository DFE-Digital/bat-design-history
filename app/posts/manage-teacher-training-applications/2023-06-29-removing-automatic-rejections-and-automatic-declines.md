We released 2 reports to show training providers how their recruitment performance was going halfway through the recruitment cycle (from 11 October 2022 to 3 April 2023).

 One report showed training providers their recruitment performance compared to the national recruitment figures.

 The other report showed the overall national recruitment performance so far this recruitment cycle.

 These reports were released on 22 May 2023.

## The issue

So far this recruitment cycle, we’ve seen a higher rate of rejections being issued by training providers. On one day we saw 718 applications rejected automatically.

 We worked with our policy team to see what we could do to improve this. Our policy team were already working on sending a letter to training providers from the Permanent Secretary. These reports would accompany the letter so that providers could positively engage in their own data and see for themselves where recruitment improvements could be made.

## What we changed

We added a new report showing training providers their own recruitment data from 11 October 2022 to 3 April 2023. The report includes 8 tables, which are:

- candidates who’ve submitted applications
- overall number of applications
- applications with an offer
- offers accepted
- deferrals
- applications rejected
- applications rejected automatically
- proportion of applications rejected

 The tables also show data from national recruitment figures so providers can easily see how they are performing against the national recruitment picture. This report is available from within the Manage teacher training applications service.

 Where a provider offers Secondary subjects, we show a breakdown of the data per subject.

 The data in the image is fake, and used for testing purposes.

We added another [report that shows the national figures](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/publications/mid-cycle-report) that we published independently from Manage. This is because there may be other people interested in national recruitment data.

## What we learnt

Over the first 3 days of launching this report (from 22 May 2023 to 24 May 2023), 322 providers viewed it. This shows providers are engaging with their own data.

In the Permanent Secretary’s letter, she mentioned that training providers could contact us if they were interested in accessing a ‘pool’ of eligible candidates to recruit from.

On the first day we released these reports, we received 12 responses from training providers asking about this. We’re now working as a team to think about a solution to this and how we can easily help providers to recruit suitable candidates.
