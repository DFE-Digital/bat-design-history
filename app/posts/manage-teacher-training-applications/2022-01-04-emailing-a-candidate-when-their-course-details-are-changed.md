We recently made changes to [let providers change course details before they make an offer](/manage-teacher-training-applications/letting-providers-change-course-before-making-an-offer/).

We needed to create an email to tell a candidate that the course details have changed.

We’ve also updated the email sent when a provider makes changes at the same time as making an offer or after they’ve made an offer.

## How it works

We send different emails depending on whether the provider changes the course details:

- before making an offer
- at the same time as making an offer or after they’ve made an offer

The provider cannot change the course details after a candidate has accepted an offer.

### Changing the course details before making an offer

We’ve created a new email since providers could not previously change the course details before making an offer.

We decided not to say which organisation made the change because:

- in the subject line we usually say what has happened and who or what it has happened to, rather than who carried out the action
- there’s a risk that if the accredited body made the change we’ll confuse candidates, as the accredited body is not mentioned in Apply or other candidate emails

We do not give the name of the accredited body in the course details because:

- it does not appear in Apply or other candidate emails
- users cannot currently change the course to one offered by a different accredited body

If in future we make it possible for users to change the course to one offered by a different accredited body, we will need to show the name of the accredited body.

We do not show funding type in the course details as it does not appear in Apply. We do show qualification type as it appears in Apply.

We tell candidates to contact the training provider with any questions, even if the user who changed the course details belongs to the accredited body. This is because the training provider is more likely to be able to answer the candidate’s questions.

### Changing the course details at the same time as making an offer or after making an offer

We’ve updated this email to reflect the decisions we made when creating the new email. It now:

- does not mention which organisation made the change
- shows the qualification
- tells users to contact the training provider even if the change was made by a user at the accredited body

{{ appEmail({
  subject: "Offer changed for ((old_course_and_code))",
  content: "
