We made improvements to the confirmation page which users see when they [defer an offer](/manage-teacher-training-applications/deferring-offers-iteration).

## What we changed

We changed the heading of the confirmation page from “Check and confirm offer deferral” to “Confirm that you want to defer the offer”. There’s nothing to check at this point.

We removed the line that says “This application will be marked as deferred” as it’s unnecessary.

We removed the line that says “You must review and confirm your offer again at the start of the next cycle (2021 to 2022).” because we’ll tell the user what to do at the start of the next recruitment cycle.

We changed “We’ll email the candidate notifying them of the deferral after you confirm below.” to “The candidate will be sent an email to confirm that your offer has been deferred.”
