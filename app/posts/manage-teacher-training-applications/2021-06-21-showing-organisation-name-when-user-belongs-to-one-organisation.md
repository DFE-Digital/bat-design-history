title: Showing the organisation name when the user belongs to one organisation
description: Always displaying the organisation name inside the caption even if the user belongs to just one organisation

We previously decided to [only show which organisation the user selected if they belong to more than one organisation](/manage-teacher-training-applications/require-users-to-choose-an-organisation-before-changing-organisation-settings/#users).

But some users were slightly confused about which organisation they were managing, even if they only belong to just one organisation.

So weâ€™ve changed it so that the organisation name is part of the caption when the user belongs to one or multiple organisations.

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [{
    text: "Organisational permissions",
    img: {
      src: "org-permissions.png"
    }
  }, {
    text: "User list",
    img: {
      src: "user-list.png"
    }
  }, {
    text: "User details",
    img: {
      src: "user-details.png"
    }
  }, {
    text: "New user",
    img: {
      src: "new-user.png"
    }
  }, {
    text: "Edit user",
    img: {
      src: "edit-user.png"
    }
  }]
}) }}
