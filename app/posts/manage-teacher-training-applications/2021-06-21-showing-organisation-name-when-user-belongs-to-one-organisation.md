We previously decided to [only show which organisation the user selected if they belong to more than one organisation](/manage-teacher-training-applications/require-users-to-choose-an-organisation-before-changing-organisation-settings/#users).

But some users were slightly confused about which organisation they were managing, even if they only belong to just one organisation.

So weâ€™ve changed it so that the organisation name is part of the caption regardless of whether the user belongs to one or multiple organisations.
