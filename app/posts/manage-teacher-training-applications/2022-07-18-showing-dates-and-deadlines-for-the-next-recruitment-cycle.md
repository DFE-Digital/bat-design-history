We have a page showing dates and deadlines in the ‘how to use this service’ section.

## What we changed

We’ve added:

- a table giving the dates and deadlines for the next recruitment cycle
- h2 headings to distinguish between the current and next cycle
- the years of the cycle for the ‘start of cycle’ and ‘end of cycle’ rows in the tables

## Future work

We plan to move information about dates and deadlines to GOV.UK. This is because it will be useful to people who do not use the ‘Manage teacher training applications’ service.
