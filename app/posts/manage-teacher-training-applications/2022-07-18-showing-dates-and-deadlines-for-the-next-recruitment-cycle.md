The guidance section of the service includes a page showing dates and deadlines for teacher training applications. It includes dates such as:

- the start and end of a recruitment cycle
- the Christmas and Easter periods, which do not count as working days

Providers sometimes want to know the dates of the next recruitment cycle, particularly towards the end of a cycle.

## What we changed

We added:

- a table giving the dates and deadlines for the next recruitment cycle
- h2 headings to distinguish between the current and next cycle
- the years of the relevant cycle for the ‘start of cycle’ and ‘end of cycle’ rows in the tables

## Further considerations

We plan to move information about dates and deadlines to GOV.UK.

This is because it could be useful to people who do not use the ‘Manage teacher training applications’ service.
