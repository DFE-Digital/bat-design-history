This work follows on from our design to [show users where candidates choose to leave the application process](/manage-teacher-training-applications/showing-users-where-candidates-choose-to-leave-the-application-process/).

We want to help users improve their processes, so that fewer candidates choose not to continue with their applications.

We tested the report with users and made changes to it during the round of research.

## What we changed

We made changes to the:

- column headings within the table
- report title

### Column headings

When we started the round of research, the report showed:

- applications withdrawn before offer made
- offers declined and applications withdrawn after offer made

We found that there were problems with dividing the data in this way. In particular, some participants were confused by the mention of withdrawing after an offer has been made.

We think that they were confused because candidates cannot withdraw when an offer has been made but not yet accepted. It’s possible for a provider to withdraw on a candidate’s behalf at this point, but no provider has actually done so.

Since the user need is to know where in the process the candidate decided to leave, we also changed the wording to emphasise this rather than how they left it.

We divided the data into 3 sections:

- before offer made (applications withdrawn) - showing the number withdrawn out of all applications received
- while considering offer (offers declined and applications withdrawn) - showing the number declined out of all offers made
- after offer accepted (applications withdrawn) - showing the number withdrawn out of all offers accepted

However, some participants thought that “while considering offer” referred to them considering it rather than the candidate.

We therefore changed the wording to make it clear who took action at each stage. The column headings at the end of the round of research were:

- before offer made to candidate (applications withdrawn)
- while candidate considering offer (offers declined and applications withdrawn)
- after candidate accepted offer (applications withdrawn)

### Report title

Once we changed the column headings, we decided that they were describing when candidates left the process rather than where they left it.

We changed the title to ‘When candidates choose to leave the application process’.
