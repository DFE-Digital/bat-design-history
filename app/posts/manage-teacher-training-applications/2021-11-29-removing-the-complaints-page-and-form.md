The candidate service recently removed their complaints form to:

- make it easier for users to get in touch by reducing the number of contact methods
- remove a support channel which looks unofficial - complaints were made using a Google form
- make monitoring complaints easier for the support team, who were not notified when a user submitted the form

We decided to remove the complaints form from our service for the same reasons. We have not removed the feedback form linked to from the phase banner, which is a different Google form.

## What we changed

We changed the link in the phase banner from “give feedback or report a problem” to “your feedback will help us to improve it.” We want providers to use the feedback form only for feedback which does not need an immediate response.

We removed the “Make a complaint about this service” link from the footer. We do not think we need a separate complaints page because:

- the email address and online chat details are in the footer
- very few users visited the complaints page - there were only 4 unique visits to the page from 27 August to 26 November 2021

## Other considerations

We considered keeping the complaints page, removing the link to the form and just giving the email address and a link to the online chat. We decided not to do this because the page would exactly replicate what is in the footer.

We considered changing ‘Get help’ in the footer to ‘Get help or make a complaint’. We decided that this puts too much emphasis on complaints. Since few users clicked on ‘complaints’ before, we do not think we need to include it here.

We will consider replacing the feedback form in a future piece of work. The detailed feedback could be given by email or online chat, but the form also contains a satisfaction survey.

We cannot decide whether to replace or remove the feedback form until we know:

- who uses the satisfaction survey and what it is used for
- what the consequences would be if we removed it
