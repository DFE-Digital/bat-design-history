We redesigned the regular sign in flow as part of [creating a start page on GOV.UK](#).

Whilst doing this work, we noticed some ways to improve the sign in flow when DfE Sign-in is unavailable.

For example:

- the content could be more consistent and clearer
- the notification banner should be full width

## What we changed

We changed:

- the notification banner and its content
- the content on the sign in and confirmation pages

### Notification banner changes

The notification banner was two-thirds in width. We changed it to be full width as standard.

The title was ‘Information’. We changed this to ‘Important’ as standard.

The content currently consists of:

- a heading which says ‘Temporary login’
- body text which says ‘DfE Sign-in is experiencing problems. You need to sign in using your email address.’

We combined this into standard heading text which says “DfE Sign-in is currently unavailable.”

### Content changes

We changed:

- “You must sign in to your account to manage teacher training applications.” to “You need to request an email with a link to sign in.”. We did this to indicate that this flow works differently to the regular DfE Sign-in flow.
- the button label from “Continue” to “Request link to sign in” which better describes the action about to be taken.

We also updated the content under the form titled “Get an account” to match the changes we made when we [created the start page on GOV.UK](#).

We improved the content on the confirmation page to be clearer by changing:

- the first sentence from “We’ve sent you an email. Click on the link to confirm your address and return to this service.” to say “Sign in by clicking the link in the email you’ve been sent.”
- the second sentence used to say “If our email does not arrive within 5 minutes, check your spam and trash folder, or [try again].” to “If you cannot find the email, check your spam and trash folder. You can also [request another link to sign in].”
