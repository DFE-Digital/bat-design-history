Research on [replacing the reference number and candidate ID with the application number](/manage-teacher-training-applications/replacing-reference-number-and-candidate-id-with-application-number/) shows that users need to be able to find all applications for a candidate.

This helps users review current applications alongside each other or compare current and past applications.

At the moment candidates can only make one choice when applying again. We’re changing this so that they can make up to 3 choices.

This means there’s more chance of providers receiving multiple applications from the same candidate.

## What we changed

We added a new section to the application called “Other applications”.

It lists all other applications which the candidate submitted in the current and previous cycles to organisations the user belongs to.

The section will not be shown if there are no other applications to list.

## Future considerations

We want to consider whether it would be useful to:

- indicate in the application list that a candidate has made multiple applications
- include details of other applications within the PDF download
