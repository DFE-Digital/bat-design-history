Research on [replacing the reference number and candidate ID with the application number](#), shows that users need to find all applications for a candidate.

This helps users review current applications alongside each other or compare current and past applications.

At the moment candidates can only make 1 choice when applying again. We’re changing this so that users can make up to 3 choices.

This means there’s more chance of providers receiving multiple applications from the same candidate.

## What we changed

We added a new section called ‘Other applications’.

It contains all the other applications the candidate sent to the provider in the current and previous cycles.
