## The context

This research covered the following areas:
* Notifications: is the design clear and understandable and does it give providers the necessary level of control over notifications?
* Application list: do providers understand the action orientated view and does it scale?
* Deferrals: do the iterated designs address previous issues?
* Diversity information: new design
* Data Export: new design

## Approach

One to one, moderated, semi-structured sessions
