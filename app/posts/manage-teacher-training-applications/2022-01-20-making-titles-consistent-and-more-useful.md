title: Making titles consistent and more useful
description: We changed all of the page titles we use across the service to use the same format.

We recently made changes to the headings we use in the service. At the same time we reviewed and made changes to the titles.

The title appears in the browser tab. It’s the first thing to be read out in screen readers so it’s important that they’re useful and consistent.

We have designed the title to be made up of the following bits of content separated by dashes:

- heading
- caption
- name of the service

## Examples

| Heading | Caption | Title |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Conditions of offer | Make offer - Jennifer Walters | Conditions of offer - Make offer - Jennifer Walters - Manage teacher training applications - GOV.UK |
| Check details and set up interview | Set up interview - Patricia Octavius | Check details and set up interview - Set up interview - Patricia Octavius - Manage teacher training applications - GOV.UK |
| User permissions | Update user permissions - Jane Smith - Wren Academy | User permissions - Update user permissions - Jane Smith - Wren Academy - Manage teacher training applications - GOV.UK |
