The ‘accepted’ and ‘conditions met’ statuses are not working as well as they could. We’ve made some changes to make them clearer.

## The ‘accepted’ status

This status means that the candidate has accepted an offer and has conditions to meet. The problem is that ‘accepted’ does not give a sense that the candidate still has conditions to meet.

To more accurately describe the status, we tried changing it to ‘awaiting conditions’. But this could sound like the user needs to add conditions.

So we changed this status to ‘conditions pending’. We used ‘pending’ as we use this term for conditions that a candidate has not met yet.

## The ‘conditions met’ status

This status means that the candidate has met all their conditions or that they accepted an unconditional offer. The problem is that ‘conditions met’ makes it sound like there’s always conditions that have been met.

To more accurately describe the status we tried changing it to ‘ready to enrol’. But there might be other tasks to do before the candidate is ready to enrol. We also found that some users did not understand what it meant.

So we changed it to ‘recruited’ to make it clear that there are no further tasks to complete within the service. We did not want to suggest that the candidate is ready to enrol, as there may be other tasks outside the service.
