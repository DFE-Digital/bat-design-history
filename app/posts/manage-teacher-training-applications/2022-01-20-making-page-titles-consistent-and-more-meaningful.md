title: Making page titles consistent and more meaningful
description: We changed the page titles to be consistent and include information from the captions.
date: 2022-01-20

We reviewed the page titles we use in the service. This was part of an audit which also included:

- [headings, caption text, success messages and timeline event titles](/manage-teacher-training-applications/changes-to-headings-caption-text-success-messages-and-timeline-event-titles/)
- button labels and warning text
- [the use of red buttons](/manage-teacher-training-applications/changing-the-way-we-use-red-warning-buttons/)
- the appearance and use of boxes

The page title appears in the browser tab. It’s the first thing to be read out by screen readers so it’s important that page titles are meaningful and consistent.

At the moment, the page title does not include information from the caption. For example, it does not include the action being taken or the name of the candidate.

The title will now be made up of the following parts separated by hyphens:

- heading
- caption
- Manage teacher training applications
- GOV.UK

## Examples

| Conditions of offer | Make offer - Jennifer Walters | Conditions of offer - Make offer - Jennifer Walters - Manage teacher training applications - GOV.UK |
