## Hypothesis

If a candidateâ€™s application is rejected, they have a chance to apply again using [Apply 2](/apply-for-teacher-training/apply-again).

Currently the provider is just given a [free text field to provide feedback](/as-launched-26-nov-2019#reject-application).

This is problematic because:

- providers may only give candidates a small amount of unstructured feedback
- different users are likely to provide varying levels of feedback to candidates
- it puts the onus on providers to type everything out manually on a repeated basis
- it puts the onus on providers to remember all the reasons they are being rejected

All of this could result in candidates not knowing why they were rejected and as a result not being motivated to apply again successfully in the future. And it doesn't empower candidates to appeal such decisions if providers make a mistake.

If providers can answer simple, structured questions
Then providers will find it far easier to provide consistent, useful feedback

We'll know this works when:

- providers answer the relevant questions
- more candidate's reapply
- candidate's avoiding applying to same provider if the provider says they won't accept future applications from them
