Our research shows that some users miss the prompts at the top of the application pages.

You can see our last iteration where we [moved the ‘banner’ below the page heading](/manage-teacher-training-applications/banner-prompt-iteration/).

This reduced the amount of users who missed it but it still happened sometimes.

So we decided to uses the [Inset text](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/inset-text/) component and add a heading inside the banner.

We’ve settled on this because we have not seen a user miss it during the last few months.
