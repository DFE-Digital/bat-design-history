Let users find applications within a huge list quickly and easily.

## Hypothesis

Currently, there's 1 long list of applications for providers to look at. This works okay for now because there's only a few applications being submitted and users are only currently assigned to 1 provider.

But users will have to manage hundreds of applications going forwards, including applications across multiple providers like those that are part of a School Direct family or universities that accredit multiple School Directs.

This will make it hard to find particular applications and make them slow to load.

### Filtering by status and provider

If we let users filter by status and provider
Then it'll be easier manage applications
Because they'll be able to find the applications they're looking for more quickly
Weâ€™ll know this works when:
- research shows there's a need to see applications for different providers at the same time
- users are able to select the statuses they want to see

### Pagination

If we let users paginate
Then pages will be shorter and quicker to load
Because they'll be less records to retrieve from the database and show users
