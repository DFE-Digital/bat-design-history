We added a new report to show providers the different reasons why candidates withdrew their application,

This feature was released to providers on 15 May 2023.

## The issue

Candidates can withdraw their application while waiting on a decision from a provider, or after having accepted an offer.

Previous conversations with providers revealed that candidates do not always discuss their reasons for withdrawing with providers.

We think that by surveying candidates on their reasons for withdrawal, and then sharing these anonymously with providers, we can help providers understand the causes of withdrawals. This may lead to actions they can take to help prevent these from happening.

## What we changed

We added a new report with a table which displays all the reasons that candidates can select when withdrawing their application. These figures are broken down into columns for 'Withdrawn before a decision' and 'Withdrawn after accepting', as well as a total.

![Screenshot showing a page titled 'Withdrawals'. After the title is the content 'Candidates who withdraw their application are asked to select their reasons for withdrawing. This is an optional question. Candidates are asked this question when they withdraw before a decision on their application is made or after accepting an offer. Candidates who have received an offer are not able to withdraw – they have to either accept or decline instead.' There is then the heading 'Applications withdrawn in the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle' followed by the content 'Candidates can select multiple reasons, so the numbers in each column may not match the ‘Total’ number. This data has only been collected from 11 April 2023.' There is then a table with columns headed 'Reason',	'Withdrawn before a decision', 	'Withdrawn after accepting' and 'Total'. There are 12 rows for the different reasons, followed by a 'Total' row.](withdrawal-reasons-report.png)

All 12 reasons are shown, even if some of them have not been selected by candidates, and they are shown with the same wording and in the order they appear in to candidates. This is to help providers understand the options candidates were selecting from.

If a provider has received less than 10 withdrawals with reasons given, then we withhold the data to protect candidate confidentiality.
