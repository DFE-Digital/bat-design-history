[Previous research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17ru6auwHbwiLT09Ge7dMrSUGEJ2jqHAxKsPisbjp4f0/edit) showed that some participants do not understand the ‘awaiting conditions’ and ‘ready to enrol’ status labels. This was particularly common for participants who belonged to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The terms did not align with their previous experience of using UCAS.

## What we researched

We were considering:

- replacing 'awaiting conditions' with ‘conditions pending’ when a candidate has accepted an offer and has conditions to meet
- replacing 'ready to enroll' with ‘recruited’ when a candidate has either met all their conditions or accepted an unconditional offer

We used a survey to find out whether providers understood our proposed statuses.

## How we did the research

For each of the status labels, we asked participants to:

- describe in free text how they understood the meaning of an application under the status label
- say whether they thought an application with this status label would have had an offer from them
- say whether they thought an application with this label would have accepted an offer from them
- read a description of what  we intended the status label to mean, then rate how well it conveyed that meaning
- give  alternative suggestions for the label, saying why they thought their label would be better

Some participants saw ‘conditions pending’ first but others saw ‘recruited’ first.

## Who we researched with

The survey was sent to 166 providers. We received 41 responses from:

- 6 Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)
- 25 School Centred Initial Teacher Trainers (SCITTs)
- 10 Schools Direct

## What we found

We found that:

- ‘conditions pending’ was well understood
- ‘recruited’ was an improvement over the current label
- providers have different understandings of what conditions are, which affects how they handle them in the service

### Understanding ‘conditions pending’

All participants described the status as we intended it to be understood.

However, HEI participants were not certain that applications in the ‘conditions pending’ state would have had the offer accepted by the candidate.

All participants, apart from the HEIs, rated the label positively.

Participants did not suggest any alternative status labels which we had not already considered.

Given that all participants accurately described the state the label represented on first viewing, this is an improvement over the current status.

### Understanding ‘recruited’

Most participants described ‘recruited’ as indicating an offer that has been accepted. They said that either that there were no conditions left to complete or the provider had never set any conditions.

When asked to suggest alternative naming, participants did not suggest anything which we had not already considered.

When asked to rate the label, 77% of participants rated it as neutral or positive. Half of those who rated it negatively still described it accurately.

### The concept of the final stage in Manage is interpreted inconsistently across providers

Almost half of the participants did not mention conditions in their description. This is concerning, as conditions having been met is one of the things that this status needs to convey.

All providers will set conditions for some applications. This means it is important that they understand that applications in the ‘recruited’ state could have had conditions and that these have now been met.

Based on these findings we cannot say for certain if ‘Recruited’ as a label accurately conveys that conditions have been met for a given application.

### It is hard to apply a single label that all users interpret consistently

There are differences in the ways that providers handle conditions.

For example, some providers consider a DBS check to be a condition which must be met before the candidate can be considered to be recruited. Others consider a candidate to be recruited before that point, with a DBS check not a condition but rather something which has to happen before the candidate starts the course. They handle this sort of requirement outside of our online service.

This lack of consistency makes it difficult to create a single status label that will be interpreted the same by all providers.
