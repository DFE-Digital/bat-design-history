As a provider
I need to defer an application on request from a candidate
So that they can take a place in the next cycle and keep a good candidate in the system

What does defer mean? It means putting an application in it's current state (according to certain rules as shown below) into the next cycle ready to be reconfirmed when the next cycle begins.

## Rules

- Candidate must have accepted the offer or beyond (Conditions met/recruited or pending)
- It must have been requested by the candidate
- Providers can defer entry at any point within the cycle
- if a candidate has met all their conditions when the offer is deferred, then the should not edit the conditions/status of conditions.
- it's up to providers to accept the request for deferring an application to the next cycle.
