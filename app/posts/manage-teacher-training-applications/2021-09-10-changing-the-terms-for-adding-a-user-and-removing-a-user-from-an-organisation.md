When we were [redesigning the email notifications for adding and removing users to and from an organisation], we noticed our terminology could be better.

At the moment we use:

- ‘invite user’ to add a user to an organisation - but the user does not get the chance to decline the invitation so it’s misleading
- ‘delete user’ to remove a user from an organisation - but deleting is not the opposite of adding and it’s less accurate because the user will still retain their DfE Sign-in account

So we’ve changed the:

- ‘invite user’ button labels and caption to ‘add user’
- ‘delete user’ link and button labels to ‘remove user’
- ‘user invited’ success message to ‘user added’
- ‘user deleted’ success message to ‘user removed’
