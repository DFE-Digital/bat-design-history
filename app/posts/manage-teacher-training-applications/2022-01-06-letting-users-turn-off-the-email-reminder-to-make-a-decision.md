We give users the ability to [manage individual email notifications](/manage-teacher-training-applications/managing-individual-email-notifications).

But we forgot to include the reminder to make a decision 20 working days before automatic rejection which we’ve now added.

## Future considerations

In future we want to consider:

- letting users configure when they receive the reminder notification
- sending one email with multiple reminders
- sending a reminder users at 10 days when the when the application window is reduced to 20 days
- whether we should change the content of the email based on whether the user has permission to make offers and reject applications
