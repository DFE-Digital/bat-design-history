Research shows providers find it useful to know exactly who did what and when regarding an application particularly in large organisations where the workflow crosses 2 providers.

## User needs

{% from "user-needs/macro.njk" import appUserNeeds %}
{{ appUserNeeds({ items: collections['user-need'] | slugs(tags)}) }}

## Design rationale

Used the [MOJ timeline component](https://moj-design-system.herokuapp.com/components/timeline) which is based on many similar components across government.

Added a horizontal line to the bottom so that it's clear where the timeline begins.
