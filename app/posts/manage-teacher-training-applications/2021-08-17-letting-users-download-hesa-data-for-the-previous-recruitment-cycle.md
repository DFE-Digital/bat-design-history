The service only lets users download HESA data for the current recruitment cycle. The data becomes unavailable once a new cycle starts.

Users need to submit this data to HESA but the deadline comes after the end of the recruitment cycle.

This may cause problems because some users may forget to download the data before the end of the recruitment cycle. They’ll then need to contact support to get the data they need to submit.

To solve this problem, we’ll let users download the previous cycle’s HESA data.

## How it works

The HESA export page will now have download links for the current and previous cycles.

The current cycle’s HESA data will be marked ‘(current)’ to help users distinguish between the 2 downloads.
