We have previously written about the [effect of removing the reference number](/). We have since analysed and researched the impact of replacing the [reference number and candidate ID with the application number](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1puOPyRmPvlTbnuocQqzO6oKtiRRoZDburdKtTNbe0nA/edit#slide=id.g1126224a75f_0_4).

Based on the findings, we decided to replace the reference number and the candidate ID with the application number.

## Summary of findings

Providers need a way to find an application by ID. They have no preference for which ID it is as along as they can use it find an individual application.

Providers use a unique ID as a way to verify that they’re speaking to the candidate.

Providers need a way to find all applications for a particular candidate. This allows them to review these applications together or check on past applications to see if they have improved.

Providers sometimes ask candidates to do a test in literacy and maths. Candidates need to enter an ID so that providers can match the test to the application. Candidates may contact support to ask for the ID.

Providers are confused about why there are so many IDs and what they mean. For example, West London Teaching School Alliance said:

> We find the number of identifiers very tricky and candidates phone me every week about whether they should use their Candidate ID or the reference number when filling in university forms to do online tests etc. They find it tricky to find their candidate ID for example. We have never understood (and indeed still don’t) the difference between the reference and the candidate ID. We originally thought the reference was the particular application to a particular provider or school but it appears not.

## What we changed

### Application details page

We have:

- removed the reference number and candidate ID
- added the application number

### Application list page

We have:

- updated the search field to search by application number, not reference
- changed the search label to “Search by candidate name or application number”
- replaced the reference number with application number within each application row

## Further considerations

We want to consider giving candidates an application number for each of their applications.
