We have previously written about the [effect of removing the reference number](#). We have since analysed and researched the impact of replacing the [reference number and candidate ID with the application number](#).

In summary:

- providers need a way to find an application by a unique ID
- candidate name is not unique because some candidates have the same name
- providers need to find all applications for a particular candidate in order to X and Y
- support users would find it easier to locate a specific application if given a unique ID

For these reasons we have replaced the reference number and candidate ID with application number.

## What we changed

### Searching by application number, not reference number

### Showing the application number within the application list and application details page

### Removing candidate ID from the application details page

### Adding a tab to view other applications
