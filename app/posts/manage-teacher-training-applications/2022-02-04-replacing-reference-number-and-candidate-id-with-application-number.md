As part of work to simplify how we use identifiers (IDs), we previously considered the [effect of removing the reference number](/manage-teacher-training-applications/finding-out-the-effect-of-removing-the-reference-number/).

We then did research into the impact of [replacing the reference number and candidate ID with the application number](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1puOPyRmPvlTbnuocQqzO6oKtiRRoZDburdKtTNbe0nA/edit#slide=id.g1126224a75f_0_4).

Based on the findings of this research, we’ve decided to replace the reference number and candidate ID with the application number.

Each of a candidate’s individual applications has an application number. It was previously only shown to the DfE support team and was known as application choice ID.

## Summary of findings

Providers have no preference for which ID they use, as long as they can:

- find an application
- find all applications for a candidate, so they can review current applications alongside each other or compare current and past applications
- verify that they’re speaking to a particular candidate

Providers sometimes ask candidates to take a test in literacy and maths. Candidates need to enter an ID so that providers can match the test to the application. Candidates may contact support to ask for the ID.

Providers are confused about why there are so many IDs and what they refer to. For example, one provider said:

> We find the number of identifiers very tricky and candidates phone me every week about whether they should use their candidate ID or the reference number when filling in university forms to do online tests etc. They find it tricky to find their candidate ID for example.
>
>We have never understood (and indeed still don’t) the difference between the reference and the candidate ID. We originally thought the reference was the particular application to a particular provider or school but it appears not.

## What we changed

We no longer use the reference number or candidate ID. We only use the application number.

### Application details page

On the application details page we have:

- removed the reference number and candidate ID
- added the application number

### Application list page

On the application list page we have:

- updated the search field to search by application number, not reference
- changed the search label to “Search by candidate name or application number”
- replaced the reference number with the application number within each application row

## Further considerations

We want to consider giving candidates the application number for each of their applications.
