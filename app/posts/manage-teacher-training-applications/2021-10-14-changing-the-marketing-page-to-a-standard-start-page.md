Since the UCAS application service has been switched off, some of the content on the [marketing page](/manage-teacher-training-applications/marketing-page-for-providers/) is no longer relevant.

We redesigned the page using the [GOV.UK start page format](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/start-pages/).

## What we changed

We changed the h1 heading from ‘manage your applications quickly and easily’ to ‘sign in to manage teacher training applications’. We no longer need to convince providers to use the service.

We included a line that says ‘if you do not have access to this service, ask a colleague to add you.’ This should help users get set up without having to contact support.

We included a line that says ‘if your organisation has not been set up to use the service, email becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk.’

We removed ‘try our new service to see how easy it is to use. It’s free for providers and candidates.’ It’s no longer optional to use our service.

We removed the following sections:

- view applications
- review applications
- respond to applications
- who’s using Apply
- what providers say
- the team

We did this because we don’t think these sections are necessary now that there is no alternative to using the service. We just need to help users realise they’re in the right place and then either sign in or get set up.

Since we removed a lot of content, it’s no longer necessary to use a custom layout with a blue top section. So we have changed to a standard page layout.

## Future considerations

### Differentiating postgraduate courses from other routes into teaching

We considered:

- differentiating postgraduate training from other routes into teaching
- mentioning that applications will come through the ‘Apply for teacher training’ service

But we decided not to make these changes because:

- the design and branding makes it clear that our service is related to the ‘Apply for teacher training’ service
- there's only one service on GOV.UK, which is for the postgraduate route
- the marketing page does not mention ‘postgraduate’

We'll monitor support queries to see whether users are confused by this after we change to the new start page format.

### Creating a start page on GOV.UK

This work is an interim solution. We plan to move the starting point for our service from a service.gov.uk domain to the main GOV.UK domain.

When we do this we’ll need to consider the needs of people who use:

- Publish teacher training courses
- Manage teacher training applications
- Register teacher trainees
