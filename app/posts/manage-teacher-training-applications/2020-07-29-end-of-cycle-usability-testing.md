title: End of cycle usability testing
---

## The context

We know that there are specific activities providers undertake when a recruitment cycle is closing. We have already run a round of research to understand the needs behind:
 
- ending a recruitment cycle
- handling “edge case” applications
- planning a new cycle
- data and reporting to DfE

See the [previous research entry for this exploration](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/end-of-cycle-exploratory-research/).
