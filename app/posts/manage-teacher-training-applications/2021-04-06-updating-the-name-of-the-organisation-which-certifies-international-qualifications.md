title: Updating the name of the organisation which certifies international qualifications
description: The organisation which compares international and UK qualifications has changed its name from UK NARIC to UK ENIC

Candidates with international qualifications need to provide confirmation that they’re comparable to the course's entry requirements.

The organisation which provides this confirmation has changed its name from UK NARIC (National Academic Recognition Information Centre) to UK ENIC (National Information Centre).

The candidate service asks for the reference number of the certificate provided by the organisation. 

The provider service gives the reference number so that users can check it online.

## What we changed

The wording in the candidate service will be changed to ask for an ENIC reference number.

Since we will not know whether the candidate entered a NARIC or ENIC reference number, we’ve decided to mention both for now. We'll review this at the end of the 2020 to 2021 recruitment cycle.
