We changed “Submitted” to “Date received” in the application details. This is more appropriate as it’s focused on the provider rather than the candidate. The status is “Received” rather than “Submitted”.

We’ll no longer show the time when the application was received. We do not think that the exact time is important to users and it’s not used when calculating the automatic rejection date.

## Further considerations

We want to consider removing “Date ” from the application details page. Users can check the timeline for this if they need it.
