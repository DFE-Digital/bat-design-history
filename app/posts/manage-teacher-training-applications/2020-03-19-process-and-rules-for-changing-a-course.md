This document describes the process and rules that providers follow when changing a candidate’s course at various stages of their application.

This is based on the as-is process, but much of it is applicable to the new provider UI.

## Making changes before provider makes an offer

**They must contact the candidate (probably by phone or email) to discuss the changes they want to make.**

A change could include: training programme, start date, location and campus.

If the candidate does not agree to the provider’s proposed changes and the provider cannot consider them for their original choice, the provider should reject their application.

If the candidate agrees to the provider’s changes, the provider can update the candidate’s original choice details in web-link (the UCAS provider UI).

## Making changes after provider makes an offer but before it’s accepted

**They must contact the candidate (probably by phone or email) to discuss before changing anything.**

### Changing interview date

If the provider and candidate agree to a change of interview date, they can record the new date by changing the offer (decision).

### Changing the details of a conditional offer

If the provider initially made a conditional offer they can change:

- training programme, start date, location and campus
- to an unconditional offer

### Changing the details of an unconditional offer

If the provider initially made an unconditional offer they can:

- change or add conditions
- change training programme, start date, location and campus

## Making changes after candidate accepts the offer

**They must contact the candidate (probably by phone or email) to discuss and have their agreement before changing anything.**

With the candidates agreement they can change training programme, date of entry, training location or campus.

If a provider has made an unconditional offer they’re committed to provide a place on that training programme, for that date of entry, at that training location.

They can only change an unconditional offer with the candidate’s full agreement.

## Candidate wants to apply to another provider after accepting an offer

**The candidate must get the provider’s agreement before applying elsewhere.**

If the provider agrees, they contact UCAS and record a decline decision in web-link. The candidate can apply elsewhere using Apply 2.

If the provider doesn't agree and the candidate still doesn't want to take up that training programme, the provider uses the 'confirmation withdrawal' decision to completely withdraw their application and bar the candidate from applying again in the cycle—can't go to Apply 2.

## Notes on changing provider

Providers can't change the provider a candidate applies to. Can only be changed by the candidate.

if a school direct wants to offer a different location within their partnership, it is done as explained above in ‘Making changes after candidate accepts the offer’. That is they agree with the candidate and make changes.

If the candidate changes provider within 7 days, they can change without having to use Apply 2.

If 7 days has passed, the candidate must withdraw their choices from Apply 1 and use Apply 2.

## What providers do if a course is full

Providers can record a ‘not considered‘ decision if a course is full.

There's guidance that says providers should help candidates by ‘offering a place on a suitable alternative course’ or ‘providing assistance to help you find a suitable alternative place elsewhere’ - this does say this in relation to ‘If you become a student, under your contract the training provider, they must do all they can to provider the educational services in accordance with the contract that you have with them.’
