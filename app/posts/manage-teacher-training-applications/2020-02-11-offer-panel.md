## Hypotheses

The [previous iteration](/manage-teacher-training-applications/august-2019#application) has a small grey status box in the right hand column of the application details view. And it uses all encompassing buttons to perform actions which make them difficult to label and harder to understand. The small width makes it hard to fit the various content such as conditions inside it.

If we put the panel at the top of the main column
Then the panel will be able to fit the content nicely
We'll know this works when:

* users spot the status box
* users are able to perform the available actions
