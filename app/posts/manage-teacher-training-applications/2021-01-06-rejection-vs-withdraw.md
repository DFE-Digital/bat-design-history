title: Closing an application at any time (withdrawal versus rejection)
description: Looking into how we can improve the process for closing an application at any time

## Background

Currently, candidates can end their application by:

- withdrawing their application (application withdrawn)
- declining an offer (declined)

They might also request their application to be withdrawn which would currently have to be done in Support.

Currently, providers can close an application by:

- rejecting an application (until an offer is made)
- letting the deadline for making a decision lapse
- withdrawing an offer
- marking a condition as not met

Currently it’s not always clear to providers what the difference is between rejection and withdrawal. And providers give candidates different types of feedback depending on what’s being done.

For example, when rejecting a candidate initially, providers fill out structured reasons for rejection. Whereas, when withdrawing an offer, they get a free text box.

So we want to look at ways to improve the process for closing an application at any time.

## Why are we doing this?

- to give candidates accurate and useful feedback why they were unsuccessful
- to allow candidates to be withdrawn at their request
- to allow providers to process applications where candidates have disappeared or stopped responding
- to make it easier for providers to choose the right action without getting hung up on terminology
- to stop providers getting punished for rejections
- to give providers confidence that they won’t get punished
- to make sure DfE can accurately differentiate between withdrawals and rejections

## What outcomes are we looking for

- less or no requests via support to ‘close off’ applications
- less or no applications being incorrectly marked as automatically rejected, automatically declined

## Key metrics

- less requests through support
- more candidates applying again / being successful when they do apply

## What we did and why

- Replaced any use of ‘reject’ and ‘withdraw’ to ‘Close application’ so that users do not get hung up on terminology
- Kept all questions on the first screen for closing an application as it’s more work to split them up for this round of research
- Always let users close an application (unless it’s already been closed) so that there’s a consistent way to close an application regardless of the status
- Let providers give additional feedback even if the reason given was that the course is full because if the candidate was poor, then the course being full is not the main reason for closing the application
- We put questions that are not a reflection of the candidate toward the bottom of the form
- Once an offer has been made, we hide irrelevant questions like safeguarding and performance at interview

## Giving a choice back to candidates under certain circumstances

We think that candidates should be given a choice back if their application is closed through no fault of their own. For example, when the course is full.

## What we want to know from research

- Do users need to distinguish between applications that were closed for different reasons on the application list?
- Do users understand what ‘Close application’ means?
- Can users figure out how to close an application when their mental model is to withdraw an application?
- Do some users go to close an application when they want to mark a condition as not met?

## Other things we considered and discarded

We originally put ‘Close application’ in a sidebar on the application page.

But from previous reseach and on the basis that we currently have ‘Withdraw offer’ on the offer page, we think that users will need to close an application from the offer page (and potentially other pages).

We also tried to only show ‘Close application’ under the candidate’s name when in the offered, accepted and conditions met states. This seemed sensible on the basis that the prompts let users close the application - like when making a decision.

But that meant an application couldn’t be closed when in the deferred state. So we decided to put ‘Close application’ just under the name at all times.
