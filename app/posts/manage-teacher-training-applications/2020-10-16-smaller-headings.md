description: Reduce the size of all headings to make them easier to read

Currently, all top level page headings are extra large (`govuk-heading-xl`).

We decided to reduce them in order to make them easier to read and follow the new default `h1` size on the GOV.UK Design System.

Here are a few before and after shots:

![Screenshot of application list before change.](application-list--before.png "Application list: before")

![Screenshot of application list after change.](application-list--after.png "Application list: after")

![Screenshot of application details before change.](application-details--before.png "Application details: before")

![Screenshot of application details after change.](application-details--after.png "Application details: after")

![Screenshot of reject application page before change.](reject-application--before.png "Reject application: before")

![Screenshot of reject application page after change.](reject-application--after.png "Reject application: after")
