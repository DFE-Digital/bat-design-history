Currently, all top level page headings are extra large (`govuk-heading-xl`).

We decided to reduce them in order to make them easier to read and follow the new default `h1` size on the GOV.UK Design System.

Here are a few before and after shots:

![](application-list--before.png "Application list: before")

![](application-list--after.png "Application list: after")

![](application-details--before.png "Application details: before")

![](application-details--after.png "Application details: after")

![](reject-application--before.png "Reject application: before")

![](reject-application--after.png "Reject application: after")
