## Past applications

As a provider
I need to see reasons why I rejected past applications
So that I can make an informed decision about the candidate if they reapply (and see if they acted on past recommendations)

As a provider
I need see past applications for successfully recruited candidates
So that if they end up underperforming I can go back and check if something was missed and perhaps understand why

As a provider
I need see past applications for successfully recruited candidates
So that I can use their application as a tool to check on their progress during the course

## Deferred

As a provider
I need to defer an application on request from a candidate
So that they can take a place in the next cycle and keep a good candidate in the system

As a provider
I need to be aware of which applications I have deferred, because I manage them differently to other candidates
So that I can check in regularly with the candidate to ensure they start the course as planned
