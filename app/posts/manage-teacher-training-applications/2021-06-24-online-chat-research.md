The support team want to launch online chat as a way for providers to seek help. It will be integrated with Zendesk, the online support system used by the team.

We wanted to find out:

- whether users could work out how to start a chat
- users’ expectations of using online chat

## What we researched

We added the Zendesk chat widget to a version of the service used for testing.

The widget appeared as a blue button labelled ‘Chat’ at the bottom right of all pages. In this round of testing we did not ask users to click the button.

## Who we researched with

We carried out research sessions with:

- 2 higher education institutions (HEIs)
- 4 school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) providers
- 3 school direct providers

All participants were administrators or admissions leads.

## What we found

Most participants located the chat button at the bottom right of the screen.

Participants said they would use online chat if it connected them to a human adviser, rather than an automated system (‘bot’).

Participants expected that if they used the chat they would:

- start by entering a free text question rather than selecting a category
- receive an email transcript of the chat after it ended
