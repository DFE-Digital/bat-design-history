Given that DfE don’t have a confirmed set of courses until rollover occurs, providers need to reconfirm deferred applications when the new cycle starts.

## How it works

When the next cycle begins any deferred applications will be in the application list.

Clicking on an application will show a banner prompting users to reconfirm the offer.

There are 3 flows we’ve prototyped to help with the initial round of user research:

1. The same course is available in the next cycle
2. The course no longer runs in the next cycle
3. The location for a course is no longer available in the next cycle

## 1. The same course is available in the next cycle

This is the most common scenario and is easiest to deal with.

When the user clicks the reconfirm button they jump straight to the check answers screen.

They have an opportunity to change details or add a conditon if they need.

The new offer is shown above the old offer on the offer page.

## 2. The course no longer runs in the next cycle

When the user clicks the reconfirm button they’re told they need to choose another course.

Clicking continue lets users choose another course.

If the user belongs to multiple providers they see the provider page otherwise they skip this page.

Then they see the course page.

Then they see the location page.

Then they see the conditions page.

Then they see the check answers page.

## 3. The location for a course is no longer available in the next cycle

When the user clicks the reconfirm button they’re told they need to choose another location or another course.

Clicking choose course takes the user down the same flow as above.

Clicking choose location takes the user directly to choosing a location.
