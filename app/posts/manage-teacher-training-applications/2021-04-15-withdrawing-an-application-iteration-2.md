{% from "email/macro.njk" import appEmail %}

The [first iteration of withdrawing an application](/manage-teacher-training-applications/withdrawing-an-application) tested whether users could:

- find the ‘Withdraw at candidate’s request’ link
- understand the difference between rejecting an application, withdrawing an offer and withdrawing at the candidate’s request

As the design tested well, this iteration is to tidy the rest of the flow and get it ready for first release.

## How it works

Users can click a ‘Withdraw at candidate’s request’ link from the application details page unless:

- the application has already been rejected or withdrawn
- any offer has been withdrawn or declined

When clicked, the user is taken to a page asking them to confirm that they want to withdraw the application. If there are any upcoming interviews then the page explains that they’ll be cancelled.

Clicking ‘Cancel’ or ‘Back’ takes the user to the application details page.

Clicking ‘Withdraw application’:

- withdraws the application
- cancels any upcoming interviews - this does not include interviews scheduled for the day on which the application is withdrawn
- takes the user to the application details page with a notification banner saying ‘Application withdrawn’
- sends an email to the candidate to confirm their application has been withdrawn
- sends an email to the candidate for each of their cancelled interviews

## Future considerations

We’re not asking for a reason for withdrawing the application because:

- the candidate may not give a reason
- if the candidate does give a reason, there’s no need to replay it to them
- we do not know what users or the DfE would do with the reason

We do have a concern that some providers may withdraw an application instead of rejecting it. If this happens, we may explore capturing a reason as a potential solution.

We’ll look out for unexpectedly high levels of use of this new feature.
