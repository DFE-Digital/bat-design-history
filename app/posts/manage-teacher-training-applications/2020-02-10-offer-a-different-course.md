## User needs

As a provider
I need to be able to change the course
So that I can ensure candidates get a place even if other courses are full up

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [
    {
      text: "Details page"
    },
    {
      text: "Edit response"
    },
    {
      text: "Make a different offer"
    },
    {
      text: "Change provider"
    },
    {
      text: "Change course"
    },
    {
      text: "Change location"
    },
    {
      text: "Change conditions"
    },
    {
      text: "Confirm new offer"
    },
    {
      text: "Flash message"
    }
  ]
}) }}
