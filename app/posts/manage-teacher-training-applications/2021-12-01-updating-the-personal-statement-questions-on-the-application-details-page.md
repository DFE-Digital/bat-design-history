The candidate team changed the personal statement questions:

- from “Why do you want to become a teacher?” to “Why do you want to be a teacher”
- from “What do you know about the subject you want to teach?” to “Why are you suited to teach your subjects or age group?”

We’ve updated the labels on the application details page to match.
