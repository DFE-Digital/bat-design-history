We made some improvements to the content when [confirming a deferred offer](/manage-teacher-training-applications/reconfirming-a-deferred-offer-iteration-3/).

## What we changed

### Changes to the application list

We changed the heading from “Deferred offers: review and confirm” to “Confirm deferred offers”.

### Changes to the prompt

We no longer mention whether the course is available in the prompt. Instead we just say “You need to confirm your deferred offer”. Details are provided on the next screen.

If the user does not have permission:

- we say “The deferred offer needs to be confirmed.”
- the heading is hidden
- the button is hidden

### Changes to the flow when the course is available

At the moment, the first screen the user is taken to is the status of conditions. Now the user is taken directly to the ‘check answers’ page. They can choose to update the status of conditions or add new ones from there.

We changed “Confirm status of conditions” to “Status of conditions”.

We changed the caption to be, for example, “Confirm deferred offer - Eloise Wells”.

On the check answers page we:

- changed the heading from “Review offer” to “Check and confirm deferred offer”
- changed the button text from “Confirm offer” to “Confirm deferred offer and tell candidate”
- removed the paragraph that says “We’ll email the candidate to confirm their new offer and remind them of the conditions for it.”

We changed the success message from “Deferred offer successfully confirmed for current cycle” to “Deferred offer confirmed”.

### Changes to the flow when the course is not available

At the moment, users have to click to reveal the details of the deferred offer. We’ve changed this so that it’s always shown.

We changed the heading from “Review deferred offer” to “Confirm deferred offer”.

We made several changes to the body to be clearer and more concise.
