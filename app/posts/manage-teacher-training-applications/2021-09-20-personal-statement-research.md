We wanted to find out what users look for in personal statements, including whether it varies between primary and secondary courses.

## Who we researched with

We carried out 5 research sessions with school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) providers.

## What we found

We found that:

- users look for different things in personal statements at different stages of the application process
- subject knowledge is only a minor consideration for primary applications 

### What users look for in the personal statement

Many providers start with a ‘sift’ in which they check that the candidate has:

- shown basic literacy skills
- written enough
- expressed themselves adequately
- put care into what they’ve written

They may reject the application if it does not meet these standards.

All providers have a ‘shortlisting’ stage, where they choose which candidates to interview. At this stage, there are differences between what they look for in primary and secondary applications. 

When shortlisting applications to primary courses, providers check:

- that the candidate shows a desire to teach at primary level and work with young children
- what relevant skills the candidate has

When shortlisting applications to secondary courses, providers check the candidate’s subject knowledge. 

When they interview candidates, providers use the personal statement for both primary and secondary courses to: 

- come up with questions
- demonstrate to candidates that they’ve read their application

### The subject knowledge section

Participants said that the subject knowledge section of the personal statement is most useful for secondary courses. The separate section encourages candidates to provide information which they may not have given otherwise.

For primary courses, participants said that this section should contain experience that could be applied to teaching at primary level. The name of the section could be clearer, for example “What do you know about primary education?”
