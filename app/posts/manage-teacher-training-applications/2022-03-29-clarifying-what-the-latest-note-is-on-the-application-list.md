We recently gave users the ability to:

- [view and search the latest note on the application list](/manage-teacher-training-applications/showing-notes-in-the-application-list/)
- [change a note](/manage-teacher-training-applications/letting-users-change-and-delete-notes/)

At the moment, the search label is “Search by candidate name, application number or contents of latest note”.

It’s not clear whether the latest note is the most recently updated note or most recently been created note.

## What we changed

We decided that the latest note is the one that was most recently created even if a note has been updated since then.

This is consistent with [ordering the notes page by most recently created](/manage-teacher-training-applications/changing-how-notes-are-displayed/). We think users will:

- add a new note, rather than changing an existing one
- only change a note to correct mistakes

We changed the label for the search box to “Search by candidate name, application number or contents of most recent note”.

## Further considerations

If we find that users often updates notes with new information, rather than to correct mistakes we’ll consider:

- showing the most recently updated note in the application list
- changing the label for the search field to match
