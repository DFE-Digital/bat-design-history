## Hypotheses

### Sub navigation

Previously, all the details of an application were all displayed on a single page. This includes the application itself, the offer, timeline and soon to be notes.

The page has got really big and hard to navigate.

If the parts of an application are split across pages
Then users will be able to find and view the applicaition more easily

### Putting offer onto a page of its own

Previously, the offer was represented by a [tiny panel in the right hand column](/manage-teacher-training-applications/offer-a-different-course/#details-page).

This meant the options for an offer were hidden behind ‘Edit response’ making them hard to discover.

If we put the offer on a page of its own
Then the options can be found more easily
