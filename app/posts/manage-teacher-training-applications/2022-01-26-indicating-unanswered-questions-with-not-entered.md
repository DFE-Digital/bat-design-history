At the moment, we’re inconsistent in how we indicate that a candidate did not answered a question.

For example, we use:

- ‘Not entered’ if a candidate does not enter a subject or grade when entering an A level
- ‘Not provided’ if a candidate does not enter anything when asked for evidence of having English skills at the required standard

To make sure we’re being consistent, we decided to use ‘not entered’. This is because it’s clearer that it’s about filling out a form field rather than giving details in some other way.
