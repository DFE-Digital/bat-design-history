As part of our work to [change the application process](/apply-for-teacher-training/changing-application-process/), we decided to allow candidates to edit parts of their application form after they’ve submitted it. Most of the changes we made were in Apply for teacher training (Apply). However, we also needed to reflect some of these changes in Manage teacher training applications (Manage).

This feature will be released in the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle which starts in October 2023.

## The issue

The new feature in the application process now allows candidates to modify some of their information within the 'Your details' section after an application submission.

These updates need to be reflected in the Manage, so that the application changes are clearly visible to the providers.

## What we changed

### Application card

We added a new line in the application card to show who updated that application, and also date and time of update.

### New notification banner

A new blue notification banner added in the 'application', to show how many days ago it was updated, and a link to view the changes that takes the user to the timeline tab.

A variation of the blue notification banner if it has been updated the same day.

### Timeline tab

We also updated the timeline tab, by adding a section for 'Application updated' to show what has been updated. e.g. address or phone number.
