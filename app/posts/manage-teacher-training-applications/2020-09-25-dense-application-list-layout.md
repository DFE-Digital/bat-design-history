Previously each application in the application list took up a lot of vertical space.

This means less applications are within the viewport at any one time.

Some users have said [they’d like a more dense layout](https://lookback.io/watch/qhXsPhfvH8c8xYRkK?t=28m9s) – [similar to what they’re used to with UCAS](https://lookback.io/watch/qhXsPhfvH8c8xYRkK?t=33m40s).

If we give users a more dense application list
Then users will be able to see more information with less effort
