title: August 2019 iteration
description: Create new states with filters.
---
An update on the [2018 prototype](/manage-teacher-training-applications/fewer-statuses), bringing the design inline with the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

* Use panels more in keeping with GOV.UK
* Use colours from the design system colour palette
* Use the tag component for statuses
* Make search work
* Use agreed list of rejection reasons (user friendly versions of the list UCAS uses)
* Add a reject by default column, replaced with "recruited" or "rejected" depending on view
* Add sortable table columns

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [
    { text: "Applications" },
    { text: "New applications" },
    { text: "Applications in review" },
    { text: "Recruited" },
    { text: "Rejected" },
    { text: "Search results" },
    { text: "Application" },
    { text: "Change application status"
  }]
}) }}
