title: August 2019 iteration
description: Create new states with filters.
tags: manage-teacher-training-applications
---
An update on the [2018 prototype](/manage-teacher-training-applications/better-statuses), bringing the design inline with the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

* Use panels more in keeping with GOV.UK
* Use colours from the design system colour palette
* Use the tag component for statuses
* Make search work
* Use agreed list of rejection reasons (user friendly versions of the list UCAS uses)
* Add a reject by default column, replaced with "recruited" or "rejected" depending on view
* Add sortable table columns

## Screenshots

    {text: "New applications"},
    {text: "Applications in review"},
    {text: "Recruited"},
    {text: "Rejected"},
    {text: "Search results"},
    {text: "Application"},
    {text: "Change application status"
  }]
