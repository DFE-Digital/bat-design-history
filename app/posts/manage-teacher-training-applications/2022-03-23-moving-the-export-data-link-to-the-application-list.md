At the moment, users have to navigate to the reports section before they can [export applications](/manage-teacher-training-applications/export-iteration-2/).

We decided to move the export link to the application list to make it easier to find. This is particularly useful for users who use spreadsheets to manage applications, as they export applications to add details to their spreadsheets.

We also think that the export link does not fit in well with the reports, which can be viewed within the service as well as being downloaded. The export can only be downloaded.

## Further considerations

In addition to the general data export, thereâ€™s also a specific export for providers to send to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). Users do not need to download it regularly.

We need to decide whether to also move the link to the HESA export, which is currently in the reports section.

We also want to consider providing an option to export only the applications that have changed or been received since the last export.
