title: Withdrawing an offer
description: Flow for withdrawing an offer

This flow shows how a provider can withdraw their offer.

## User needs

As a provider
I need to withdraw an offer
So that I can rectify a mistake I've made or stop an unsuitable candidate from taking a spot

## Research findings

1 participant said to change from ‘Withdrawn by us’ to ‘Offer withdrawn’ because a candidate cannot withdraw an offer, only their application. We'll change the states for the next round of research to:

- Offer withdrawn
- Application withdrawn

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [
    {
      text: "Application in offered state"
    },
    {
      text: "Edit response"
    },
    {
      text: "Withdraw offer"
    },
    {
      text: "Confirm withdrawal"
    },
    {
      text: "Application in withdrawn state"
    }
  ]
}) }}
