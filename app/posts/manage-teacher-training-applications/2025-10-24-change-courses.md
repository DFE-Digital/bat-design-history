## Background

Until now, initial teacher training providers needed to contact our support team if they wanted to make any changes to the course that they have offered someone a place on.

For example they might need to change the location the course will take place at, or whether it’s a full- or part-time place.

They should always discuss any changes with the candidate first.

We already allow providers to make changes to applications in the following states:

* received
* interviewing
* offered

There is work in progress to allow them to make changes to an offer that has been deferred in the previous cycle.

## What we did

We have made it possible for training providers to change aspects of a course someone has been offered a place on from within Manage when it’s in the ‘conditions pending’ state.

When any of these elements of an offered course are changed, we will email the candidate to let them know. They should be expecting the change, having discussed it with the provider before making it. If the change is unexpected we direct them to discuss with the provider in the first instance, and contact support if they cannot resolve the issue.

## What’s next

Our support colleagues told us that requests to change the details of an offered course come in mostly for offers in the ‘conditions pending’ state. However we should monitor this and discuss whether to expand the ability to make changes to offers in other states.

We have not included the ability to change the training provider that a course has been offered by, but if a provider user has access to more than one provider, they may want to make this change. We will also monitor the ongoing need for this and discuss implementing it if needed.

We have included content on each change screen to remind the provider that they must get permission from the candidate before they make changes. We should monitor instances of candidates receiving unexpected changes to their offers and consider whether we need to request proof that a candidate has given permission for the changes before we allow them.
