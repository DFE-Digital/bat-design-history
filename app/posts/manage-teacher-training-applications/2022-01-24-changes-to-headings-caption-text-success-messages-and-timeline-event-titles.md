We reviewed the headings, caption text, success message and timeline events we use in each flow of the service. This was part of an audit which also included:

- page titles
- button labels and warning text
- the use of red buttons
- the appearance and use of boxes

## How it works

We created a [spreadsheet with the new heading, caption text, success messages and timeline event titles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfI8Es-Q1_klKeiYe5r2znlr688b12lRIOZF_dt5EwI/edit?pli=1#gid=0).

### Headings

Previously we had inconsistent headings such as:

- “Check and update course” on the check answers page when updating the course the candidate applied for
- “Check your feedback and reject application” on the check answers page when rejecting an application
- “Add note” when entering a note
- “Location” when selecting a location

All headings that describe form controls will no longer say ”Add...“, “Select...” or “Enter...”.

All headings on check answers pages will now begin with “Check details and...”.

### Captions

Previously some flows had captions and some did not. We’ll now use captions for every flow to describe the action being taken.

All flows that are triggered by ‘change’ links will have caption text starting with “Update...”. For example, when changing an offer the caption says “Update offer”.

### Success messages, timeline and activity log events

We aligned the success messages, timeline and activity log events with the changes to caption text.

For example, when updating an offer:

- the success message is “Offer updated”
- the timeline and activity log titles are “Offer updated”
