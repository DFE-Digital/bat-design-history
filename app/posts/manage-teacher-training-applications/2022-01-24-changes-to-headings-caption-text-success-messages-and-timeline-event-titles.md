We reviewed the headings, caption text, success messages and timeline events we use in each flow within the service. This was part of an audit which also included:

- page titles
- button labels and warning text
- the use of red buttons
- the appearance and use of boxes

## How it works

We created a [spreadsheet with the new heading, caption text, success messages and timeline event titles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfI8Es-Q1_klKeiYe5r2znlr688b12lRIOZF_dt5EwI/edit?pli=1#gid=0).

### Headings

At the moment, we have inconsistent headings such as:

- “Check and update course” on the check answers page when updating the course the candidate applied for
- “Check your feedback and reject application” on the check answers page when rejecting an application
- “Add note” when entering a note
- “Location” when selecting a location

We’ll now make sure all headings on check answers pages begin with “Check details and...”. For example:

- “Check and update course” will be “Check details and update course applied for”
- “Check your feedback and reject application” will be “Check details and reject application”

We’ll delete ”Add...“, “Select...” and “Enter...” from headings that describe form controls. For example, “Add note” will be “Note”.

### Captions

At the moment, some flows have captions and some do not. We’ll now use captions for every flow to describe the action being taken.

All flows that are triggered by ‘change’ links will have caption text starting with “Update...”. For example, when changing an offer the caption says “Update offer”.

### Success messages and timeline event titles

We changed the success messages and timeline event titles to be consistent with the new caption text.

For example, when updating an offer:

- the success message is “Offer updated”
- the timeline event title is “Offer updated”
