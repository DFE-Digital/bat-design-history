Additional questions have been added to the candidate service. We need to give the answers to providers.

## What candidates enter when they apply

When giving their nationality, candidates must choose one or more options from:

- British
- Irish
- other - this reveals a field where they can choose a nationality

### Candidates who are British or Irish

Candidates who are British or Irish are asked “Will you have lived in the UK in the 3 years before your teacher training starts?”

### Candidates who are not British or Irish

Candidates who are not British or Irish are asked “Do you have the right to work or study in the UK for the length of the teacher training course?” The options are:

- yes
- not yet

#### Candidates who have the right to work or study in the UK

Candidates who have the right to work or study are asked “What is your immigration status?” The options are:

- EU settled status
- EU pre-settled status
- other - this reveals a free text field for them to give details

Whatever they answer, they are then asked “When did you enter the UK?”

#### Candidates who do not have the right to work or study in the UK

Candidates who do not have the right to work or study are asked “How will you get the right to work or study in the UK?” The options are:

- a visa sponsored by a course provider
- another route - this reveals a free text field for them to give details

## What we changed

We have:

- removed the automatic assessment of fee status
- added the responses to the new questions which are asked in the candidate service
- changed how we refer to addresses given by candidates

### Automatic assessment of fee status

We have removed the automatic assessment of fee status. It was not possible to give an accurate answer since we did not have enough information. Providers always needed to make a final decision after talking to the candidate.

Even once we ask more questions within the candidate service, we still will not have all the information we need for an automatic assessment. We’ve decided to give providers the information we have so that they can make their own assessment.

### Responses to the new questions which are asked in the candidate service

We’ve split the personal details section of the application details into:

- personal information
- contact information

This means that:

- the sections reflect those in the candidate service
- the answers to the new questions appear at the end of the ‘personal information’ section rather than in the middle of a larger section

We’ll replay the questions exactly as they’re asked in the candidate service.

For example, we do not want to give the impression that the service has assessed that the candidate has the right to work or study in the UK. So we’ll include the full question “Do you have the right to work or study in the UK for the length of the teacher training course?”

We will not include responses that are given only so that the candidate can enter further details. For example, if a user selects “other” as their immigration status then we will not include that answer. We’ll include only the details the candidate gives.

### Changing how we refer to addresses given by candidates

Candidates were previously asked to enter an ‘address’. They are now asked to enter a ‘contact address’.

​​​​This is to make it clearer that the address may not be their permanent home address. It should not be used when considering where a candidate is resident or making a fee assessment.
