We currently have the following sections within ‘your account’:

- Personal details
- User permissions
- Email notifications

But some users mistake their permissions to be about their colleague’s permissions.

To solve this we’ve changed the heading to ‘your user permissions’. And to be consistent we’ve changed the other pages and link text to match.

Changing ‘email notifications’ to ‘your email notifications’ meant that we could also remove the sentence explaining that the notifications are related to the current user.
