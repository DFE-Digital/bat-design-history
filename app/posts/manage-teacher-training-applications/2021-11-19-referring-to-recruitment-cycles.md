At the moment we’re inconsistent in how we refer to recruitment cycles.

We use a mix of phrases like:

- year
- cycle
- recruitment cycle
- recruitment cycle year
- academic year
- ITT followed by the start year - for example, ‘ITT2022’
- year received followed by the start year - for example, ‘2021 to 2022 (starts 2022)’

We want to be consistent across Manage, Publish, Register and Support in order to make it easier for providers to understand what we mean.

## How we’ll refer to recruitment cycles from now on

We want to use a term which is clear and does not require prior knowledge to understand. For example, ITT2022 would be confusing to anyone who did not know:

- what ‘ITT’ means
- that ‘2022’ refers to the year the course starts, rather than the year in which candidates are recruited

We’ll use the full phrase ‘recruitment cycle’.

When it’s useful, we’ll append ‘- current’ to mark the current recruitment cycle.

We’ll always use a period like ‘2021 to 2022’ rather than just the year the training will start.

## What we changed

On the application list page we:

- changed the filter label from ‘Year received’ to ‘Recruitment cycle’
- changed ‘2021 to 2022 (starts 2022)’ to ‘2021 to 2022’
- added ‘- current’ to the current recruitment cycle

On the application details page we:

- changed the label from ‘Year received’ to ‘Recruitment cycle’
- changed ‘2021 to 2022 (starts 2022)’ to ‘2021 to 2022’

On the HESA export page we changed ‘2021 to 2022 (current)’ to ‘2021 to 2022 - current’.
