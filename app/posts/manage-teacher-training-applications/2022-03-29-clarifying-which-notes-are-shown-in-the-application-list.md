We recently gave users the ability to:

- [view and search the latest note on the application list](/manage-teacher-training-applications/showing-notes-in-the-application-list/)
- [change a note](/manage-teacher-training-applications/letting-users-change-and-delete-notes/)

At the moment, the search label is “Search by candidate name, application number or contents of latest note”.

It’s not clear whether the latest note is the most recently updated note or most recently created note.

## What we changed

We decided that the latest note is the one that was most recently created. We’ll continue to show the most recently created note in the application list even after an older note is updated.

This is consistent with [ordering the notes page by most recently created](/manage-teacher-training-applications/changing-how-notes-are-displayed/). We think users will:

- usually add a new note when they have new information, rather than changing an existing one
- only change a note to correct mistakes

We changed the label for the search box to “Search by candidate name, application number or contents of most recent note”.

## Further considerations

If we find that users often update notes with new information, rather than to correct mistakes, then we’ll consider:

- showing the most recently updated note in the application list
- changing the label for the search box to match
