{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}

## The context

We know that there are specific activities providers undertake when a recruitment cycle is closing. This research was to understand provider needs for:
* ending a recruitment cycle
* handling "edge case" applications
* planning a new cycle
* data and reporting to DfE

We also wanted to assess design changes for:
* reasons for rejection
* adding a way for providers to see the question guidance shown to candidates
* sorting controls, adding the ability to sort by Reject By Default (RBD) date

## Approach

One to one, moderated, semi-structured sessions
[Discussion guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gbTev2fd9cAAkVgP6JDYoZXSL_1M7PUgA_DAZIJrwFU/)

## Who we researched with

Provider users, typically ITT administrators or ITT Directors from:
* 7 SCITTs
* 2 Schools Direct
