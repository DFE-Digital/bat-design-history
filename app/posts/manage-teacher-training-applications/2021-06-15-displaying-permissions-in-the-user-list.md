At the moment, the user list page only shows the name and email address of each colleague. To view permissions, the user needs to click through to the details page.

If we show permissions in the list, then users who:

* just want to check permissions can do so without clicking through
* cannot manage users won’t need to click through to a page where they’re unable to change anything

It may be harder to scan the list to find a specific colleague. But as most organisations have, on average, 3 users this seems unlikely to cause a problem.
