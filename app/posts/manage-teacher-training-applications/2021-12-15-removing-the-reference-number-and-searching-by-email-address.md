description: As candidates no longer get a reference number for their application, we have removed it. Users can now search by email address instead.

When making an application, a candidate can choose up to 3 courses.

Once the candidate submits their application, each choice becomes an application that the provider receives.

Candidates used to be given a reference number for their main application. But the [reference number was removed](/apply-for-teacher-training/dashboard-changes/) because:

- very few candidates ever quoted it when contacting support
- the support team use the candidate’s email address to find their application

Additionally, if a candidate applies to more than one course at the same provider, searching by the reference number will result in multiple applications.

For these reasons, we want to try:

- removing the reference number from the application list and details pages
- removing the ability to search by reference number
- adding the ability to search by email address

Before making any changes to the live service, we want to find out if:

- providers need the reference number
- if it’s helpful to search by email address
- support users ever need the reference number
- it would be better to search for an application that lets them find a specific application
