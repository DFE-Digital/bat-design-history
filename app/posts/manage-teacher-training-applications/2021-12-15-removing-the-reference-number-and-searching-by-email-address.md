A candidate can apply for up to 3 courses.

Candidates used to be given a single reference number for all the applications they made at the same time. But the [reference number was removed](/apply-for-teacher-training/dashboard-changes/) because:

- very few candidates ever quoted it when contacting support
- the support team find the candidate’s application using their name or email address and details of the course

For these reasons, we want to try:

- removing the reference number from the application list and details pages
- removing the ability to search by reference number
- adding the ability to search by email address

## What we want to find out

We want to carry out research with providers and support users to find out:

- whether providers need the reference number
- whether its’s useful to search by email address
- how we can help users distinguish between applications from the same candidate
- how we can help users find related applications for a particular candidate
- what support agents need from candidates and providers
- whether we should stop encouraging vendors to use the support reference
- how we can help users find an application without personally identifiable information

### Finding out if providers need the reference number

The reference number is misleading because it appears as though it’s unique to an application. But as it relates to multiple applications, we think we should remove it.

Before doing so we want to see if providers need it for another reason such as being asked to quote it when contacting support.

### Finding out if it’s useful to search by email address

If a provider is contacted by a candidate, they may need to search for their application in the service. If there are multiple applications from candidates with the same name, the provider may need a way to distinguish between them.

We wanted to find out whether it would be useful for providers to be able to search by email address. This would be harder to ask for and type compared to name, but it would be unique to a candidate.

### Helping users distinguish between applications from the same candidate

If a candidate applies to more than one course at the same provider, searching by reference number, candidate name or email address will return multiple applications.

To select the right application, the user would need additional information like the course name. They’d need to either ask the candidate or check notes outside the service.

We want to find out how much of a problem this is and if it would be better to let users search by a unique ID for the application.

### Helping users find related applications for a particular candidate without having to search

Some users who use both student record systems and Manage have requested the ability to search by candidate ID. This would let them find all applications that relate to a specific candidate.

Using the reference number is not a reliable way to do this because it only refers to applications made at the same time. The candidate can have more than one reference number.

To search using the candidate ID, a user would have to find it then cut and paste it into a search box to find the related applications.

We want to find out if it would be better to let users view all related applications for a particular candidate without having to search.

### Finding out what support agents need from candidates and providers

Candidates no longer provide their reference number to support because they do not have it.

This has made some support requests more difficult to deal with. For example, one candidate contacted support using an email address that does not match the one they used to apply.

Their name was also obfuscated. This meant the support agent had to go back to the candidate for more information.

We want to find out what support agents need from candidates and providers to carry out support requests efficiently.

### Finding out whether we should stop encouraging providers to use the reference number

Vendors have not fully understood the purpose of the reference number. They have shown signs of confusion about whether the reference number was unique to a candidate or to an application. Neither of which is true.

Because of this, we have had to spend a lot of time encouraging vendors to use the reference number when referring to applications. This way candidates, providers and support agents can all use the same reference number to refer to an application.

In response, vendors have enabled the ability to search by reference number. Manage also lets users search by reference number.

But candidates are no longer given a reference number. And the reference number does not refer to a unique application. Therefore we want to remove it from student record systems and Manage.

But doing so would mean going against what we have been communicating and would not allow users to find applications easily.

We want to find out the user needs of users who work in Manage and student record systems to find out whether:

- we can remove the reference number
- introduce a unique application ID
- stop encouraging vendors to use the reference number
- start encouraging vendors to use a unqique application ID

### Helping users find an application without personally identifiable information

We want to check whether support agents asking for personal details about a candidate is compliant with the UK General Data Protection Regulation.

We want to check whether there’s a difference between:

- asking for this information over email
- sharing this information around multiple internal systems such as Slack

If a candidate emails support they’ll include their name and email address anyway.
