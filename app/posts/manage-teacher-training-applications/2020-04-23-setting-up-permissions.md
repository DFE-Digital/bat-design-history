Training providers can work with multiple accredited bodies who ratify their courses. Some providers also ratify their own courses.

Who can do what at which organisations varies depending on the specific relationship.

For example, take a training provider who runs courses, some of which are ratified by one organisation and some by another.

The first accredited body may be responsible for making decisions (and the training provider cannot). Whereas the second accredited body shouldn’t make decisions (as thats the responsibility of the training provider).

If we let training providers set permissions for their organisations
Then organisations will not do or see something they’re not meant to.

## The situation with Titan Partnerhship

We tested a rough prototype with a user who processes applications for Titan Partnership Ltd and Aston Manor Academy and has the ‘manage organisation’ permission.

The journeys include:

- setting up permissions for partner organisations for the first time
- inviting a new user to their organisation
