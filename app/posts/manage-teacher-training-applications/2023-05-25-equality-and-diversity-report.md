We released a new report to show providers a summary of the sex, disability, ethnicity and age of their applicants

This feature was released to providers on 15 May 2023.

## The issue

Candidates can optionally answer questions about their sex, ethnicity, disabilities and health conditions when submitting an application. Providers only receive this information if a candidate accepts an offer from them. Date of birth is required and revealed straight away.

Providers looking to improve the diversity of their trainees may benefit from more data about the diversity of people applying for courses, as well as those recruited, so that they can see if different groups are disproportionally more successful in being recruited.

## What we changed

We added a new report with a tables for each of the 4 characteristics: sex, disability and health conditions, ethnicity and age.

Each table summarises the number of candidates with each characteristic, with columns showing how many applied, how many received an offer, and how many were recruited (accepted an offer).

A final column calculates a percentage of candidates recruited from the total number of candidates who applied. This allows the recruitment rate to be compared across characteristics.

The design of the final report was based on one [previously designed and researched](/manage-teacher-training-applications/simplifying-how-we-help-users-spot-bias-in-their-recruitment-processes/), but with some changes to the disability and health conditions section to reflect changes in the way that this question is now asked.

Instead of summarising the number of candidates who are disabled or not disabled, the table now includes rows for "at least 1 disability or health condition declared" and "I do not have any of these disabilities or health conditions".
