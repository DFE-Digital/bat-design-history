In 2023, we produced two [performance reports](/manage-teacher-training-applications/provider-recruitment-performance/) midway through the recruitment cycle so that providers could compare their performance to last year’s and the national picture.

For 2024, we made this report dynamic and refreshed it weekly on Monday. This means providers can continually monitor their performance and better understand applications, withdrawals, rejections, and deferrals throughout the year. We hope that having access to this data will encourage providers to use it in their decision-making about the recruitment journey, improving the candidate experience and supporting their wider recruitment strategies.

This year's data is focused on candidates rather than applications. This change came from feedback on the 2023 report stating that a single candidate could make 4 applications and only one could be accepted, but the data would show three rejections. This gives an unfairly negative view of the situation.

For this report, the data measures candidates, not applications.

The data in this report is for illustration only.

## Feedback on the report

We sent a survey to providers and held a face-to-face interview on the 2024 performance report.

The survey included 7 questions:

1\. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the below statements about the content and usability of the report?

Statements:

- the order in which the information was presented in the report is logical
- the information presented in the report is easy to understand
- the report is simple to use and accessible to me
- the layout and organisation of the report is easy to understand

Answer options:

- agree
- somewhat agree
- neither agree nor disagree
- somewhat disagree
- disagree

If the participant answered ‘disagree’ or ‘somewhat disagree’ to any of the above statements, we encouraged them to provide more information.

2\. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the below statements about the use and value of the report?

Statements:

- the report being delivered on a weekly basis is useful to me
- it is useful to compare my performance data with the national average performance data
- the report contained all the information which I expected to see
- the ability to view historical performance data would be useful to me

Answer options:

- agree
- somewhat agree
- neither agree nor disagree
- somewhat disagree
- disagree

If the participant answered ‘disagree’ or ‘somewhat disagree’ to any of the above statements, we encouraged them to provide more information.

3\. How frequently would you view this report?

Answer options:

- more than once a week
- once a week
- once a month
- less than once a month
- I’m not sure

4\. How useful is the information in the report?

Answer options:

- all the information in the report is useful
- most of the information in the report is useful
- some of the information in the report is useful
- none of the information in the report is useful

If the participant answered ‘most’, ‘some’ or ‘none’ of the information, we asked what information in the report was not useful to them?

5\. Who in your organisation would use this report?

Answer options:

- Head of ITT
- ITT course leader
- Administrator
- Team leader
- Other

6\. How would you use the information in this report?

7\. Do you have any suggestions for how this report could be improved?

## Key findings

- The report’s order, layout and content were mostly reported to be logical, useful and easy to understand.

- Providers would find it useful if they could share the report with other stakeholders who don't have access to Manage.

- The report’s data may present a misleading picture of the providers' recruitment performance due to the absence of context. For example, there may be good reasons for them not to have made an offer within 30 days, but this isn’t reflected in the report.

- Providers would use the report to:
  - understand application patterns and gaps, particularly around the subject area.
  - compare their performance data with national data, but would find it useful if they could filter by geographical location.

- It would be useful to filter for specific data, including international and domestic applications and location.

- Most sections of the report are useful; however, the purpose and value of table 8. ‘Proportion of candidates who have waited more than 30 days for a response’ are unclear to some providers. The interview participant thought that this data was intended to prompt providers to review their processes around accepting or declining offers.

## Next steps

The report tested well overall, so there are no urgent changes. This is expected as the report is an improvement based on feedback from the mid-cycle report in 2023.

We will implement recommendations for allowing providers to share the report with others and monitor support tickets and other feedback routes. Analysing how often the report is accessed would also help us understand whether we need to make historical reports (not just the last week) available to providers.
