We did a survey of providers and a single face-to-face interview on the 2024 performance report.

## Key findings

- The report’s order, layout and content were mostly reported to be logical, useful and easy to understand

- Providers would find it useful if they could share the report with other stakeholders who don't have access to Manage

- The report’s data may present a misleading picture of the providers' recruitment performance due to the absence of context (for example, there may be good reasons for them not to have made an offer within 30 days, but this isn’t reflected in the report)

- Providers would use the report to:
  - understand application patterns and gaps, particularly around the subject area.
  - compare their performance data with national data, but would find it useful if they could filter by geographical location

- It would be useful to filter for specific data, including international and domestic applications and location

- Most sections of the report are useful; however, the purpose and value of the ‘30 days’ section are unclear to all providers

## Next steps

We need to:

- conduct a second round of user research to review provider use of the recruitment performance report and collect more feedback
- implement recommendations for allowing providers to share the report
- monitor support tickets and other feedback routes
