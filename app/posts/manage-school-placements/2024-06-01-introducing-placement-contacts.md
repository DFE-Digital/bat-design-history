During [user research round 1](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-1-findings/), a school user expressed nervousness that ITT providers may start contacting mentors directly if their names were visible. Schools have a dedicated staff member to manage their ITT placements. This person is often referred to as the ITT coordinator and they are listed as the 'Placement contact' within our service. ITT coordinator responsibilities do not sit with a particular role in the school, they could be assigned to any teaching post or senior leadership position.

In [user research round 2](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-2-findings/) ITT providers told us about contacting the main point of contact for the school. Finding this person can be a pain point for them and they specified that they would need this information to be prominent in the service for the service to be usable.

>â€œUsually, what we would do is: once the school has said that they would be willing to host a trainee, at that point, we would then contact the main point of contact and ask them who the mentor would be for the trainee.

## What we did

- We added the ability for schools to add a placement contact to their details in the service.
- We made it mandatory to have placement contact details recorded in the service before placements could be added, to ensure that all school placements have corresponding contact details.
- We added the ability for schools to change their placement contact, but not to remove them. Once a placement contact is added, the school must always have one to avoid placements without a contact.
- We updated the ITT provider's view of a placement to include the placement contact at the top.

## How it works

When a school has no placement contact, the placements page explains that they must add one before placements can be added. There is a link to the form that allows them to add the placement contact.

The placement contact details are collected on a single page. They are first name, last name and email address. First name and last name are optional fields, to accomodate the use of shared mailboxes.

Once a placement contact is in place, their details can be seen by the school on their organisation details page. The placement contact information is shown to providers at the top of a placement's information.

## How it tested

All of the users we tested with understood the need to add a placement contact and navigated through the journey without any problems.

Full details can be found on [insight 2 of the user research round 3 findings](https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-3-findings/#insight-2).

## Further considerations

One user asked why the placement contact did not get set automatically to the user of the service. We did consider an option to do this and to allow organisations to specify which users should receive communications from ITT providers. We decided against this because we can't ascertain that just because someone is a user of the service they are also the placement contact. While this is sometimes the case, there would often be multiple users and only one placement contact.

We considered a number of language options. Different schools have different names for the position. We settled on placement contact because it was high level and understood by all users in testing.
