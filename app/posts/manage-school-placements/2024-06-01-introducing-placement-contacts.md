During [user research round 1](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-1-findings/) we identified a school user concern that providers may start contacting mentors directly. Schools have a dedicated person to deal with their ITT placements. This person is often referred to as the ITT contact or placement contact. The position does not sit with a particular role in the school.

In [user research round 2](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-2-findings/) providers told us about contacting the main point of contact for the school, and specified that they would need this information to be prominent in the service for the service to be usable.

>“Usually, what we would do is: once the school has said that they would be willing to host a trainee, at that point, we would then contact the main point of contact and ask them who the mentor would be for the trainee.

## What we did

- We added the ability for schools to add a main placement contact to their details in the service.
- We made it mandatory to have placement contact details in place before placements could be added.
- We added the ability for schools to change their placement contact, but not to remove them. Once a placement contact is added, the school must always have one to avoid placements without a contact.
- We updated the provider's view or a placement to include the placement contact at the top.

## How it works

When a school has no placement contact, the placements page explains that they must add one before placements can be added. There is a link to the form that allows them to add the placement contact.

The placement contact details are collected on a single page. They are first name, last name and email address.

Once a placement contact is in place, their details can be seen by the school on their organisation details page. The placement contact information is shown to providers at the top of a placement's information.

## How it tested

All of the users we tested with understood the need to add a placement contact and navigated through the journey without any problems.

Full details can be found on [insight 2 of the user research round 3 findings](https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-3-findings/#insight-2).

## Further considerations

One user asked why the placement contact did not get set automatically to the user of the service. We did consider an option to do this and to allow organisations to specify which users would recieve contacts. We decided against this because we can't ascertain that just because someone is a user of the service they are also the placement contact. While this is sometimes the case, there would often be multiple users and only one placement contact.

We considered a number of language options. Different schools have different names for the position. We settled on placement contact because it was high level and understood by all users in testing.
