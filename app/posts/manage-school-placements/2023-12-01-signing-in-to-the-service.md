To access Manage school placements, users must use Department for Education (DfE) Sign-in.

DfE Sign-in is how schools and other education organisations access DfE online services including all services in Becoming a teacher (BAT).

## How it works

Before accessing the Manage school placements service, users must be invited either by someone in their organisation or someone from BAT support.

Once added to the organisation, users will receive an email with a link to sign in.

To access the service, users will either need:

- an existing DfE Sign-in account
- to create a DfE Sign-in account if they haven't used DfE Sign-in before

Users can create DfE Sign-in accounts with any email address, but it’s expected that users will create an account using their organisation email address rather than one from a free email service provider such as Gmail and Hotmail.

The DfE Sign-in account email must match the email used to invite the user otherwise we cannot sign the user in; their organistion will be unknown.

If the user needs to create a new DfE Sign-in account, there is a bug in which DfE Sign-in forgets which service they’re signing in to. In this case, users have to go back to their original email to follow steps to sign into the service.

Once signed in, if a user is inactive for 20 minutes, their session will time out and they will be signed out.
