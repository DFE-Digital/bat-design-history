## Who we spoke to

In this round, we spoke to 7 schools currently taking part in the Essex Private Beta trial. All sessions took place remotely over Microsoft Teams.

The research participants included:

- 2 primary schools
- 1 all-through school
- 5 secondary schools

## Goals of the research

We wanted to observe as schools used the service for the first time to indicate whether they were willing to offer placements for the forthcoming academic year.

​We hoped that running this study as the Private Beta launched in a new area would help ensure schools could successfully record their preference for offering placements and complete the journeys for each of the three available options. It would give us confidence that the journeys we launched were usable or allow us to iterate quickly if we found they were not.

## What we tested

We asked participants to use the link sent to them when they were onboarded to access the service. We watched as they signed into Manage school placements using DfE Sign In, creating an account where necessary.

Participants then saw the initial ‘Expression of Interest’ question asking them to indicate whether:

- Yes – I can offer placements (green route)
- Maybe – I’m not sure yet (amber route)
- No – I can’t offer placements (red route)

During these observations, all participants selected the green route. However, two participants had either used the service previously or someone in their organisation had. Both had previously selected the amber route.​

## Key insights

### Insight 1

We saw varying levels of enthusiasm for using the service, based on each school’s current circumstances.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

Those who were looking to market themselves to new providers to find more trainees were most positive about the service's value. Those who were open to working with new providers could also see its value. ​

Those who worked with many providers responded warmly towards it, believing it could cut down on email traffic back and forth.​

Those who had strong relationships with a single provider were the least positive about the service's value. They indicated they would prefer to maintain current ways of working.

We also saw a mixed response from the Lead Partner we spoke to. They found the service so easy to use she would be happy to complete it for her 60 partnership schools. However, they worried that if they were left to complete it themselves, they would not do so in time, adding to workload. They pointed out a potential opportunity for the service to link into Publish, to save them manually updating available schools on each course.​

> “So if it works the way I think it's going to work, and I hope it's going to work, I think in a couple of year's time it will be really, really useful and it's exactly the sort of tool that schools need. At the moment, we all sort of work as little islands and we all have our own set of information. The providers work as little islands with their own information. Bringing that together makes perfect sense…” Primary, Headteacher

> “There's a lot of extra coming into the school with this, versus providers looking at their trainees and the schools in their local area. So rather than the experts at [our provider] being able to place people where they know they will flourish, this becomes a very different approach…” Secondary, Assistant Headteacher

### Insight 2

The service’s purpose was not fully understood by all.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

We have anecdotal evidence that some people have filled in the service without fully understanding what it is for. ​

The question 'can I edit' or 'can I come back and change' was also asked in many sessions.​

Some participants were unclear on the next steps once they had added placements.​

Some were also unclear that this was an expression of interest, rather than committing them to offering placements.

### Insight 3

For some, May was too early in the academic year for them to be confident in what they would offer in September.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

Some participants indicated it was too early for them to tell which placements they could offer and when. They told us they would be more certain of what placements they could offer in June or early July, when resignations had happened and timetables were set for the following academic year.​

This indicates they should potentially have taken the amber pathway.​

In addition, four participants told us it was too early for them to tell who the mentors would be. They said schools would be more likely to know this information towards the end of the summer term. ​

> “That's a hard question only because I don't know where teachers are yet placed for next year... to be that specific now is quite hard...​” Primary, ITT Lead

> “Sometimes the mentor information comes in quite late because of the timetables, people changing roles and responsibilities. Sometimes that can be decided right at the very end of the summer term...​” Secondary, Professional Tutor and Induction Tutor for ITT and ECT

### Insight 4

The length of placements affects the number of placements schools can offer.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

Schools who take trainees for a full year placement are likely to be able to offer fewer shorter placements. Conversely, schools who take trainees on shorter placements are likely to be able to offer more.​

Because of this, participants either expected to be able to indicate the placement length they were looking for, or to have some indication of the placement lengths providers offer before adding placements.​

One school wanted to be asked approximately how many trainees can they take in total. They could be flexible on the subjects offered, so long as that limit was not exceeded.

No participants used the ‘expected date’ function in the way we expected them to. One selected autumn term to mean their starting date on full year placements, another wanted two shorter placements to fill up the entire academic year so selected autumn, spring and summer term

> “I’m not sure what the question is asking - I could possibly have one each term in reception and I've got two classes, so that would be 6. Or I might just have one when they're in school for a year on apprenticeship. So I don't know the answer. It's not clear enough about what type of placement it's talking about...” Primary, Headteacher

> “We'd be expecting to be asked approximately how many trainees could you take for each placement period. And then even though we're saying that we've got perhaps 8 subjects where we have capacity... we can probably only have 4 trainees” Secondary, Professional Tutor

### Insight 5

Participants are likely to use the Manage ECT’s service in addition to ours. The login details are not the same, which led to confusion.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

3 participants had no issues signing in using their DfE Sign-In credentials.​

2 did not have DfE Sign-In but were able to create account on the call.​

2 tried to sign in with their 'Manage ECT' credentials and got very confused when the verification did not come through.

This indicates we need to make it clearer that the Manage ECT login details are different, and they must create a DfE Sign-In account to use our service.

## Recommendations and next steps

Following this round of research we plan to:

Identify the key archetypes across the school users we have spoken to. Use these to help prioritise who we build the service for.​

Consider what more we could do on setting expectations on what the service is for, and wayfinding into and out of the service. ​

Consider whether we need to rethink the 'amber' and 'green' pathways. If most schools are not clear on the exact number of placements they can offer until later in the term, they may technically be 'amber’.​

Consider what we could do to allow schools to state the specific types of placement they are looking for e.g. full year, long or short. Also consider how to deal with schools who add more placements than they can offer.​

Consider how we make it clear that the Manage ECT login details are different, and they must create a DfE sign in account to use our service.

We will look to iterate the service to incorporate these recommendations, then retest in future rounds of research.
