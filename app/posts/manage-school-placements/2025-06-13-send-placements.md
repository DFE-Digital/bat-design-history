## Insights

As detailed in [user research round 6 findings](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-6-findings/), specifically insight 4, we found that the first version of the ‘add placement’ flow did not meet the needs of special schools. A user from a special school told us they wanted to know that the placement appears to providers as SEND-specific, and to be able to select mixed year groups.

In [user research round 10](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-10-findings/), we learned that some special schools are not being asked by providers to host trainee teachers on placements even though they would be interested in doing this. You can read more about this in the design history [Understanding more about schools' ways of working](/manage-school-placements/understanding-more-about-schools-ways-of-working/), specifically insight 4.

User research participants spoke about increasing SEND requirements in mainstream schools and a need for more teachers with experience and expertise supporting students with SEND in both mainstream and SEND settings. Due to this, future teachers would benefit from gaining teacher experience in SEND settings during their initial teacher training.

## Iterations

We have iterated our service to ensure it can support the recruitment of teachers who are trained to support students with SEND,

As part of the design of the expression of interest flow, we added a set of questions to help schools indicate whether they have a SEND specific placement. This is done during the bulk add flow, at the point where a user would select an education phase.

If the user selects SEND specific, they will be asked additional questions on what key stages they can offer placements at, and how many at each stage.

In SEND specific schools, key stages can be more flexible, so we have enabled users to associate multiple key stages to a placement with a mixed key stages option. It is expected that the details of this will be discussed between the school and the provider to ensure that the placement is a good fit and provides the necessary learning for the trainee.

For provider users, we’re introducing a filter to allow them to show only schools with SEND specific placements. This will help them to place trainees in SEND environments. The presence of the filter will also help to make more providers aware of the opportunities.

## Next steps and considerations

This feature will be monitored to ensure usefulness and suitability for SEND schools and schools with high SEND provision.

We are specifically interested in understanding whether the options for key stages fit with their ways of working, and whether there are other factors about SEND specific placements that schools need to communicate to providers.

We have also investigated the specifics of SEND provision types in schools, based on data from Get Information About Schools, and this may be introduced in future if it helps bring clarity.
