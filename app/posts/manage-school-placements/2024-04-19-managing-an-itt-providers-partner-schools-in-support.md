We added a way for Support users to manage partner schools on behalf of initial teacher training (ITT) providers.

## How it works

### Partner providers list


### Partner provider details


#### Not entered versus unknown information


### Adding a partner provider


#### Finding a partner provider


##### Data validation rules


#### Check your answers


##### Not entered versus unknown information


### Removing a partner provider


## Further considerations

We considered some changes that we did not implement. These included:

- uploading schools in bulk
