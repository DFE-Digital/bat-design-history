The lifecycle of a school placement differs according to the school, ITT provider, and trainee. We are testing our understanding of a typical placement lifecycle through the Manage school placements private beta.

## Creation of a school placement

Schools typically initiate a placement by offering to one or more initial teacher training (ITT) providers. They do this around Easter time (when resourcing for the next academic year is confirmed) in response to ITT providers’ information requests to confirm what placements they can offer.

ITT providers sometimes initiate a placement by asking a school to accommodate a specific trainee teacher.

In less common instances, trainees initiate a school placement by contacting a school to ask if they will host them.

Creating a school placement can happen as early as a year before the trainee starts the placement or as late as the day before.

## Organisation of a school placement

ITT providers and schools work together to arrange school placements. They establish whether the key attributes of the school placement (for example, subject, mentor, and placement window) suit the specific requirements of a trainee teacher (for example, subject, specialism, phase, and age range).

ITT providers arrange at least two school placements for each trainee to give them varied experiences and enable them to meet all the teachers’ standards. [More details are contained in the ITT criteria](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65ccac0ec96cf300126a3718/2024-25_ITT_criteria_and_supporting_advice.pdf).

A trainee’s first placement typically happens in the autumn term (September to December), and the second placement commonly occurs across the spring (January to March) and summer (April to August) terms. Dates and durations of placements differ between ITT providers and may also be influenced by a school’s availability to host a trainee.

ITT providers ensure a trainee is matched to the most appropriate school and mentor. Schools have differing levels of influence over which trainees are placed with them. Some schools may have staff representation on an ITT provider’s trainee interview panel. Other schools may only receive confirmation of who they are hosting a few weeks before the placement starts.

Many ITT providers compare the process of organising school placements for a cohort of trainees to a jigsaw puzzle. They identify placements and provisionally plan which trainee they will send to each school. As they recruit more trainees throughout the recruitment year and identify more school placements, they move trainees to different placements to ensure all are matched appropriately. This is why schools and trainees often receive details of their placements from ITT providers close to the placement start date.
