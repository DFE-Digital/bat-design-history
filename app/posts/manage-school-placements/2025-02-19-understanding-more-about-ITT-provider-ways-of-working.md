## Who we spoke to

In round 8 we visited two Universities and observed their tools in use. We then interviewed three School Centred ITT providers (SCITTs) and asked them to show us the tools they used. All participants helped us map out the steps they took to find placements and place trainees throughout the year.

In round 9, we issued a survey to all accredited providers who use our Register trainee teachers (Register) service:

- We received 96 survey responses from 77 distinct organisations
- This is 45.3% of all accredited providers
- 70 were SCITTs, 26 were Universities

## Goals of the research

Our goals for user research round 8 were:

- to gather sufficient information to be able to map the end-to-end process and timeline ITT providers currently follow to organise placements for trainee teachers each year.
- to learn about the tools ITT providers use and observe them in use.
- to identify any pain points with current ways of working that DfE could help with.

In round 9 we wanted to:

- understand more about how ITT providers operate around the country and the tools they use to find and monitor school placements.
- learn more about any issues with placement supply.
- understand if surfacing data on school engagement in ITT could be useful to providers.

## Key insights from our observations with providers (round 8)

### Insight 1

There is no 'one size fits all' for providers; SCITT and University processes are very different

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- SCITTs tended to go out to schools first and limit recruitment of candidates up to the number of placements schools offered them. In contrast, Universities had a separate admissions team and no caps on candidate numbers. Placement teams had to find placements for all candidates who were accepted onto an ITT course.
- SCITTs tended to induct candidates and tell them about their placements in July, so they could introduce themselves to schools before the summer. Universities matched schools and candidates over the summer, then informed candidates shortly before placements began.
- SCITTs tended to work with fewer schools, had stronger relationships and recruited less candidates. Universities recruited more candidates and had fewer close relationships with schools. They asked almost all schools in their area for placements.

> “We won't recruit and offer to somebody unless we know we can place them” - SCITT

> "We place every student, we get there eventually but it takes a lot of work" - University

### Insight 2

As-is tooling seems to meet each organisation's needs

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- Organisations who used software solutions spoke very positively about them and used them at every stage of the lifecycle. They had often customised their software to meet their needs.
- Smaller SCITTs used spreadsheets to help them organise placements. They had developed them to meet their needs, but conceded they may not scale should the organisation get bigger.

> “The software we use has everything we need in it” - University

### Insight 3

Opportunities exist to make things better

#### Supporting detail and evidence

While existing tooling seemed to meet user needs, pain points emerged which could be opportunities for us:

- Contact details of ITT Coordinators (who organise and offer placements from within schools) are difficult to find. Emails often get ignored or bounce. If a provider wants to work with a new school, they will reach out to the Administrator or Head in the first instance.
- There seems to be a gap in some schools' understanding of what ITT is. Participants mentioned having to educate schools on what is involved.  Research with schools who are not currently offering placements will give us a better understanding of this problem.
- Schools can cancel placements at the last minute or suggest mentors who don't have time to perform the role adequately.
- Not all DfE systems have APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) available yet. This results in manual work arounds for downloading GIAS data and uploading details to 'Register'.

### Insight 4

Matching candidates and placements is a time-consuming job

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- When looking to match a candidate to a school, all participants said travel time was a crucial factor. Universities limited travel time at 90 minutes. SCITTs limited at 45 or 60 minutes. All participants used Google or Apple Maps to check this. They also considered the candidate’s mode of transport and whether they had health conditions or caring responsibilities that might affect their commute.
- Participants mentioned schools can drop out late in the process, causing additional pressure. This is normally due to schools' circumstances changing, for example a recent change in leadership, mentors going on leave or because another provider might have taken the placement.
- While all organisations found the matching process time consuming, it seemed to be much harder for Universities. The more placements needed, the more labour intensive the process seemed to be. Universities were also matching up until placements started, leaving little time if schools dropped out. In contrast, SCITTs started matching around Easter, or as they recruited.

> “Because we work with a set number of schools, I think we know the schools really well in terms of where trainees will fit, which schools will support our trainees" - SCITT

> "I always say it’s like trying to do a jigsaw when someone keeps taking away a few pieces or adding a few pieces. At the end of it, it’s really good but it’s a big, time consuming part of my role" - SCITT

> "It's long and stressful… We place every student, we get there eventually, but it takes a lot of work" - University

## Key insights from our provider survey (round 9)

### Insight 1

Most respondents were able to find the placements they needed last year, but the outlook for this year seems more challenging.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- Almost all respondents were able to find the placements they needed last year. Only 10 were not able to find the placements they needed. Of those 10, five rejected or withdrew offers to candidates.
- 65% of respondents told us it had been more difficult to recruit schools this year.
- 46% felt unsure or not confident they will find all the placements they need.
- The biggest challenge for finding placements was mentor capacity.

>"School mentors have a higher workload and so capacity for mentoring is a challenge, particularly where working with multiple providers. - SCITT

### Insight 2

Respondents were split on what DfE could do to help support them with finding and managing placements.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

Some respondents thought a digital service like Manage school placements would be useful. Others thought DfE should focus efforts elsewhere. This reinforces the ‘no one size fits all’ theme we saw in round 8.

- 18 respondents thought grant funding for mentor training should be maintained and additional ones introduced to help schools.
- 17 thought a directory or list of schools willing to host would be useful. 4 specifically mentioned a database of contact details.
- 13 said DfE should make it a requirement for schools to host. 8 said we could do more to encourage schools to get involved in ITT.
- 8 said DfE should not get involved in helping to manage placements. Most of these respondents indicated they were happy with the status quo and their own personal relationships.

>" It would be great if they had central list of schools asking for trainees so that ITT Providers can contact them if they are struggling to place trainees. Similar to the DfE job vacancy, Schools could enter information about what trainee in any particular subject they are looking for." - SCITT

>"I think the system needs to ensure that providers and schools that have a long-standing partnership can continue to work together without being forced to use a new system. I see the system as being useful if a school has a surplus and is looking for a trainee teacher in a certain subject, a school is new to teacher training and doesn't want to make their own approach to multiple providers or a provider hasn't been able to find a placement through their usual channels." - University

### Insight 3

Most respondents used common office software packages like spreadsheets, surveys and emails to help them find and manage placements.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- Use of software solutions was not common among respondents when finding placements. Only 10 out of 96 respondents used off-the-shelf software solutions. Universities were more likely to use bespoke software solutions than SCITTs.
- Most respondents also used common office packages like Microsoft 365 or Google Drive to monitor how things were going on placement. Some used off-the-shelf software solutions.

### Insight 4

Surfacing additional data DfE holds would be useful.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

We asked respondents whether it would be useful to know the number of trained mentors in a school, or whether a school has offered placements recently. This is data DfE holds from other teacher recruitment services:

- Most respondents said knowing the number of trained mentors would be useful, with 72% saying moderately, very or extremely useful.
- Respondents thought this data would be useful to help them determine which school was the most appropriate to contact, judge their capacity for mentoring, rank the offers they had from schools or understand how much mentor training would be required. Some said this would not replace their need to build personal relationships with new schools.
- Most respondents said knowing whether a school had previously hosted placements would be useful, with 69% saying moderately, very or extremely useful.
- Respondents thought this data would be useful to help them judge a school's previous experience with ITT and whether they understand what it takes to host a trainee, to target new schools to work with or to understand how much mentor training might be required.
- Some respondents had feedback on what we could do to provide more useful information:

>"Just because they have hosted before doesn't mean that they are open to hosting for other providers. What would be useful is to see who hasn't hosted and then reasons why." - University

>"This data is only useful if this is not made a further 'competition' between all providers in a saturated area - it becomes a cold calling/hounding exercise to secure places, which is not helpful to us or the school receiving calls. What would be more useful is schools not currently engaging being encouraged to become involved with ITT." - University

## Mapping the insights

We used these insights to help us develop a customer journey map. This is a visual tool used to represent how a user navigates a service. It explains the activities they perform and their experience of them. This outlines the user's challenges and opportunities over time as they try to complete their task. The visual nature of these diagrams helps the whole team build a shared understanding of the user experience.

In our map, we differentiate between University and SCITT providers to demonstrate how different their experiences are during the year as they place candidates. Moving forward, we will use this representation of providers' current experiences in conjunction with our insights, as a way of pinpointing where in the process challenges are arising for providers and schools, and why. We will use this as a jumping off point to help the wider team make decisions on iterating the service in future concepts or designs.

## Next steps

We now have a greater understanding about how providers work throughout the placement life cycle and the decisions they make when placing candidates. We will:

- proceed with the plan to incorporate the data DfE holds into the service and usability test this with providers ahead of build, to make sure it is useful and understandable.
- carry out user research with schools who are offering placements regularly to understand what the process is like for them.
- carry out user research with schools who are not offering placements to understand their reasons why and what information / support they would need to get started.
