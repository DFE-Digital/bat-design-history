## Who we spoke to

In user research round 16, we spoke to 5 providers in Essex to hear about their experience of trialling our service with their placement schools. 2 sessions took place in-person and 3 sessions took place remotely over Microsoft Teams.

The research participants included:

- 1 HEI
- 4 SCITTs

## Goals of the research

We wanted to understand what providers’ experience of using the service was, as it had been live for over a month. We hoped this round of research would highlight any issues preventing them from using the service fully, any technical problems or other challenges. We also hoped it would highlight any areas that were working particularly well.

## Key insights

### Insight 1

Providers value the close working relationships they have with their partner schools. The service becomes useful when their usual schools can't accommodate a trainee, and they need to look beyond their existing partnerships.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- Providers either match a trainee to an available placement or find a placement for a specific trainee.
- They initially reach out to schools they’ve worked with the previous year. If they’re unable to find a placement for a trainee they will then reach out to their alumni network, schools they haven’t work with before, or even their provider representative body or another local provider.
- Providers told us our service could be beneficial to them if they were unsuccessful in finding a placement through their normal contacts and process.

> “This is probably going to be more useful when looking for placement outside our partnership.... I think it'd be fantastic if we can. If we've tried our tried and tested schools and we can't find a placement for a trainee and then we go on here and we'll be able to search for schools that we don't usually work with” – U69

### Insight 2

- Providers are less likely to use the service if all schools are not using it to list their placements/availability.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

Providers are currently using the service to find new placement schools, and they are more likely to use the service if all schools are using it to share their placement availability for a given academic year.

> “If schools really get behind it and it does what you want it to do and it saves us time. But if it’s not going to get that full level of buy in then we’d only use it for looking for new schools”. – U71

> “the ease of use is great… but it’s another thing to look at a very tight time, especially if we search regularly and there’s no placements” – U70

### Insight 3

Providers have concerns about how up to date the information is on the service.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- Some providers work to fixed cut off dates by which schools need to confirm placement details – one for placement 1 and another for placement 2.
- Others manage it as an ongoing process throughout the year, often using a colour coded spreadsheet to track the status of each placement.
- If the service doesn’t show when a school last updated their information then providers cannot trust the information that it’s showing. As a result, providers then go back to their current ways of working.

> “when we originally looked for this German placement, it probably was at least a month ago, I think when I first looked and one of our partnership schools came up, we thought, oh, fantastic... you've got a place. German. But we'd already asked them and they'd said no. So we were like, okay, I'm not sure how up to date this information is” – U69

> “From a school's perspective, you've got to be careful - they might forget to update it. They might think they have capacity now but by January their capacity might have changed. If you're going to select 'any time' you'd need alerts in case things change” – U73

### Insight 4

Providers need to know if schools are open to accepting candidates for their placement from other routes such as apprenticeships and salaried route as well as full and part-time trainees.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- Currently, when a school completes their expression of interest (EOI) journey they are not asked whether they will accept candidates from specific routes e.g. salaried or apprenticeships.
- Therefore providers have to reach out to relevant contact at the school to inquire about this.

> “So information that could be useful could be whether they could take a salaried or unsalaried place, whether they will only consider full time, part time, something like that” – U69

### Insight 5

Placement schools need to know a provider's placement length and startdate, and providers are happy to share these.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- In [user research round 12](https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/manage-school-placements/testing-concepts-with-schools-and-providers/), we found that schools would find it helpful to have more information about provider ways of working, including their placement dates and patterns as each provider operate to different timeframes.
- In [user research round 14](https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/manage-school-placements/testing-concepts-with-schools-and-providers/), schools responded positively to the “provider directory” concept we tested.
- 4 out of 5 providers in this round have said they would be happy to share their placement timeframe and start/end dates.

> “Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. We had a meeting with the school outside of our partnership this morning and we were discussing exactly that’ – U69

> “I think that's important. You know, lots of providers do things differently and it's important for the trainees applying to understand what that looks like and for the schools to understand what that looks like. Because, you know, university HEI based programme would be really different to sort of SCITT provision. So I think it's important for them to kind of go in with their eyes open, really” – U72

### Insight 6

Minor technical fixes would improve providers’ experience of using the service.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- Giving providers the ability to restrict the radius of the location when searching for schools would be helpful to them as they don’t look beyond certain radius when looking for placements for a trainee.
- Whilst looking through a list of schools in the Find page, pressing the back button doesn’t return you to the original page the user was on within their initial search, it takes them to the first page instead.
- Listing placements for each school in alphabetical order would be easier to read.

> “You can click on school but if you go back (back button), it takes you back to the start of list again, rather than where you left off” – U71

> “So we typed in Essex, but the first school showing was in London. So we were wondering if it's by distance, isn't it? So we would have preferred, if possible, for that to be schools based in Essex” – U72

## Recommendations

Following this round of research, we held a workshop with the design and development team to discuss recommendations for iterating the service. These are:

General:

- To recommend the development of a "provider directory" so that schools have a single place to search for provider information such as placement length, start date etc.
- Add an additional question on the [expression of interest](https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/manage-school-placements/expression-of-interest-flow-for-school-users/) flow to let providers know what routes they're willing to accept trainees on, including salaried and apprenticeship routes.
- Explore what can be done to support schools hosting placements for neurodivergent trainees, to help them accommodate reasonable adjustments and give the right support to their trainees.

Technical and content related improvements:

- Add a "last updated" status/tag on placement page so that providers know how up-to-date the information is.
- Add URN to the listing page
- Add link to OFSTED report on school details pages
- Go back to selected paginated page when clicking the back button after viewing a school on the “Find” page
- Review content on what adding a placement means, to improve clarity around whether it's number of trainees or number of placements
- Order placements on the “Find” show page by subject name
- Remove the “schools you work with” page as providers are interpreting it differently and it is causing confusion.
- If, in future, the service becomes a “Find” service instead of “Manage” placements service, we should consider importing a list of schools from the Register service for individual providers so that they can select the schools they have recently worked with and filter for schools outside of their network.
- Consider adding an export functionality for providers to be able to export data about each school (characteristics) e.g. mixed school, school type etc.
- Explore whether a hierarchy is needed in the “users” tab to allow/restrict individuals to add/remove users.
