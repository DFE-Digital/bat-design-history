## Introduction

Following our research to understand more about ITT provider and school ways of working, our team held an ideation workshop to generate new ideas for how our service might meet user needs and remove barriers for users in engaging with the service. In this workshop, we came up with eight different concept ideas, of which two were prioritised for design and testing. They were:

‘Expression of Interest’ for schools: allowing schools to indicate whether they were willing to offer placements this academic year. This included the ability to add multiple placements at once

‘Find a School’ for providers: this tested favourably in [round 11](/manage-school-placements/concept-testing-with-providers/), but had been iterated based on user feedback

In addition, stakeholders were interested in understanding whether sharing data that the Department for Education (DfE) holds would benefit schools and/or providers.

## Who we spoke to

In round 12, we spoke to 5 schools from across the country, none of whom had seen our service before. We prioritised those who do not offer placements every year, to see if our concepts might encourage them to offer placements for trainee teachers in future.

In round 13, we spoke to 6 Universities and School Centred ITT providers (SCITTs) of varying sizes from around the country. Only one had seen our service before.

In round 14, we spoke to 4 schools from across the country, none of whom had seen our service before. Again, we prioritised those who do not offer placements every year.

All these sessions were carried out remotely, using MS Teams.

## Goals of the research

Our goal for this research was to gather feedback on whether the concepts were worth pursuing. We wanted to understand whether our proposed functionality would make it easier to find placements, or welcome trainees into schools. In addition, we wanted to get a sense of which data items would be most beneficial, should DfE choose to make them available to schools or providers.

We ran this research across 3 rounds in 2-week sprints, alternating between concepts tailored to schools and to ITT providers.

Our research questions were:

- Do ITT providers and schools find the concepts useful and/or usable?
- Do they think these concepts would help them find placements or trainees more effectively?
- Would these concepts help ways of working? If not, what could be done to improve them?

## Round 12: ‘Expression of Interest’ and data sharing

In this round we tested our ‘Expression of Interest’ concept with schools. They were prompted to enter the service via an email from DfE. They then saw a ‘start page’ asking them to pick one of three options to indicate whether they were offering placements in the next academic year. These options led to:

- A ‘green’ journey, where schools were asked to indicate the number of placements they were willing to offer in specific subjects or key stages
- An ‘amber’ journey, where schools could indicate they may offer placements but would like more information from ITT providers before committing
- A ‘red’ journey, where schools could indicate they were not open to offering placements

These journeys are summarised in the visual below, but more information can be found in the detailed [Expression of Interest design history](/manage-school-placements/expression-of-interest-flow-for-school-users/).

### Key insights: ‘Expression of Interest’

Most participants found this concept easy to use and understood what they were being asked to do. They did not have a problem with being emailed by DfE rather than a provider, although two acknowledged it was a change to current ways of working.​

While most participants were positive about placement information being held in one place, there were concerns about duplicating information across multiple services. Participants would be less in favour of this service if it became an additional task, and they had to continue sharing placement offers with providers separately. ​​

Some participants also voiced concerns about getting more contact from providers if their emails were listed on a service like this.

> “This suggests we’re putting a for-sale sign outside the school for providers to contact us as they wish. From a school’s perspective, this could potentially increase the amount of comms we’re getting from multiple providers…​” – Secondary, Senior Assistant Principal

As feedback on this concept was broadly positive, we recommended taking it forward. The team prioritised fixing usability issues that had been identified and we tested an iterated version in round 14 (see below).

### Key insights: data sharing

As with previous rounds of research, this round highlighted that provider ways of working can make things hard for schools and prevent them from working with multiple providers. For this reason, schools expressed a need to learn about providers before working with them. ​

Three out of four participants scored ‘information about providers’ highly. This information would benefit schools looking to work with new or additional providers. For this reason, the team decided to develop an additional concept, the ‘Provider directory’, to be tested in round 14. Information on trainees also scored medium-high in terms of usefulness for schools.

## Round 13: iterated ‘Find a School’ and data sharing

In this round we tested our iterated 'Find a School' concept with providers. In this version, we introduced a new start page, simplified navigation and iterated placement statuses:

![Iterated find a school user flow](R13-FAS.jpg "Iterated find a school user flow")

We gave participants the following scenario:

>"We would like you to imagine that you’ve got a candidate for your secondary English course whose term time address is in SE14. You don’t currently work with any schools in that area, so you’re looking to find new schools to work with."

We then showed participants a Lucid board with a series of post it notes which represented data items DfE has available and could share with providers. Participants were asked to rank each on a scale where 1 = not at all useful and 5 = extremely useful.

### Key insights: ‘Find a School’

On the overview screen, participants drew out issues with having candidates on the system: ​

Some look for placements for candidates even if they have not firmly accepted, others wait for firm acceptance

Some always look for more placement offers than they have candidates, to account for location or last-minute changes. This means that the calculation is more complicated than number of trainees x number of placements

The status tags for 'not hosting' was understood, but 'unfilled placements', 'already organised' and 'open to hosting' were unclear to some. One thought 'open to hosting' would be the main catch all for schools who wanted to offer.​ Participants indicated that even if the status was ‘already organised' or 'not open to hosting', they may still contact them if they have their details. ​

Information on trained mentors split opinion. While two thought it was useful to see whether there were mentors in the school already, three said stating only this was not helpful. They expected more information about mentor subject specialisms, who they have trained with or whether they were an ECT mentor.​

All participants were able to navigate between the tabs, and all were broadly positive about the information they could see, especially the ITT contact details, travel time and information about the schools. ​Two indicated they would like to download data from the service, either to share with Ofsted or to help with internal matching. ​

While most participants were positive about using the system to help find placements in a new area or if they were struggling with existing contacts, most would not expect their partnership schools to list placements on it as they worried about losing offers. They believed it would be a secondary system where schools could add surplus placements, rather than a single route for schools to add placements. ​

> “Our lead school? I would say I hope they weren’t on it… they’re our lead school and they’re loyal to us first. It sounds really bad doesn’t it? But I wouldn’t want them supporting our competitors if we’re still looking for placements…” SCITT

As feedback on this concept was broadly positive for providers looking to work in a new area or to help find new partnerships, we recommended taking it forward.

### Key insights: data sharing

Participants were not shown any stimulus for this, so opinions varied on what the data might show. Some participants thought the data would be for their organisation only, others thought it would be stats from across the country.

Participants indicated that the most useful data items would be information on placement schools and information about early career teacher vacancies. Most thought it would be useful to see trends among trainees across regions and nationally. While information about course application outcomes scored poorly, two participants said the reasons for rejection would be very useful, particularly if they could also obtain contact details for that candidate to offer them a place.​

As we did not see consistent themes emerge across this data, we recommended doing more research in this area, including sharing a survey with providers.

## Round 14: Provider Directory and iterated ‘Expression of Interest’

The need for schools to be able to find information to help them find providers in their local area, and learn about their ways of working, emerged in round 12. In this round, we tested the idea of a Provider Directory with schools. We asked them to look at the following screens in a Figma prototype and give us their feedback on the information shown. We also asked whether there was any information missing they would find useful:

![Provider directory user flow](R14-PD.png "Provider directory user flow")

We then showed participants our iterated ‘Expression of Interest’ concept. Participants saw:

- A new email with more directive content prompting them to use the service
- An iterated start page
- An additional question on the subjects they would like to host, before entering the green, amber or red route
- The green route had a simplified ‘Placements’ page and content changes. The ‘Select provider’ page was removed
- The amber route had only minor changes

![Iterated find a school concept](R14-PD.png "Screens from the iterated find a school concept")

### Key insights: ‘Provider Directory’

Participants were generally positive about our initial ideas for the Provider Directory, but its usefulness depended on how open they were to working with new providers. For participants who were in stable relationships with providers and were not looking to expand their offering, the service had limited utility, although one conceded it would be useful to see all the information in one place:

> “Because I'm working with so many different providers, I'm trying to get that information [on placement dates] and then obviously keep it in a little folder and try and keep on top of it. But actually, having it all in one place, that seems really, really useful. So I like that. I like that a lot, especially when you've got a little bit detail there about the curriculum​” – Secondary, ITT Lead

One participant was very new to ITT and had a lot of questions about what it entailed. Some of the language used in the concept was unfamiliar, such as ‘Accredited provider’, ‘Lead School’, ‘SCITT’ and ‘Placement pattern’. They mentioned they would also like to understand:

- different training routes, especially for TAs who want to become teachers
- the costs involved for the school
- whether a vacancy needs to be available
- whether it can be done full or part time​

We recommended taking this concept forward, subject to carrying out additional research with providers to see if they would be open to providing information like this.

### Key insights: iterated ‘Expression of Interest’

We did not test any gov.uk guidance as part of this round, so the first thing the participants saw was the email from DfE prompting them to use the service. This meant they may have lacked context on the intent of the service.​ While most participants understood the intent, it was not clear to some what they were signing up to. Two participants questioned the level of commitment from the school to host what they had filled in, once placements were listed. One thought the intent was for DfE to do the matching of students to placements.

Participants saw benefit in the centralisation of placement listings. The email coming from DfE made it feel more important or more of a priority:

>”I think there’s an element of ‘oh it’s from the DfE, we better respond… I have just got one from [a local provider] about sharing interest for next year and I think I’d actually be more inclined to complete this one than that…​” Primary, Headteacher

The question ‘Do you know which subjects you would like to host’ was not relevant for participants from primary schools. They would expect to declare whether they were a primary or secondary before being asked for this information. ​

On the amber journey, participants expected to give more information on the type of placement they were looking for. They also voiced concerns about additional contact from providers if their email was listed, as we saw in round 12.

On the green journey, the ‘select primary school subjects’ screen caused confusion, as most participants thought about offering placements for primary only, not primary with a subject specialism. One was unsure whether they would be able to edit placements once they were listed, leading us to consider whether we needed additional wayfinding in the service.

## Next steps

Through testing and iterating the ‘Expression of Interest’ and ‘Find a School’ concepts with schools and providers, we proved that this functionality could help schools looking to work with new providers, or providers interested in expanding their network of partner schools.

For this reason, we decided we would launch versions of both concepts into our Essex Private Beta trial, subject to addressing the feedback on usability issues outlined above.

We now plan to organise live observations and retrospective interviews with schools and providers, to see them using the service for the first time and gather their feedback on its usability.

We will also monitor service analytics carefully, to see if there are any areas of concern where users are not completing their journeys. We will use this insight to help formulate questions for qualitative research.

In addition, we plan to send feedback surveys to schools and providers at regular intervals, to gather additional feedback on how useful and usable they find the service.

## Further considerations

As mentioned above, the Provider Directory concept gathered positive feedback from schools in round 14. However, it would need more research to be taken forward, as we are unsure whether providers would be willing to provide the level of information needed to make this product a success. We also have questions about where to gather this data, and whether our team would be best placed to build this functionality, or whether it would be more beneficial to align with another team in the service line.

We have shared all feedback we have gathered on this concept with the [Manage teacher training applications](/manage-teacher-training-applications/) service team, as they are primarily responsible for collecting data about courses for trainee teachers. This service is also used regularly by providers. In addition, we have spoken with the Register trainee teachers team about their [Register of training providers work to learn more about their new service](/register-of-training-providers/why-we-need-a-register-of-training-providers/), and the potential dependencies a Provider Directory may place on it.
