To statistically assess the similarity of the characteristics of placement schools in our shortlisted areas compared to the broader placement school population, we employ two statistical tests suited to the data types:

1. For continuous variables (such as the number of pupils and percentage of free school meals), a 2-sample [Wilcoxon Rank Sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test) test compares median values across independent samples.

2. For categorical variables, [Fisher’s Exact Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test) evaluates the distribution of schools across each characteristic, which is particularly useful when dealing with small sample sizes or categories with low expected frequencies.

We use these tests to determine if the characteristics of our sample differ significantly from those of the wider population.

Even if we find statistical significance, it’s crucial to consider the practical relevance of the findings, as statistically significant results may not always translate into meaningful or impactful differences in real-world contexts. To help adjust for this, some characteristics are also compared on only the largest categories (accounting for >90% of the sample) to mitigate the influence of less frequent categories on our results.

## Representativeness to wider placement school population

As highlighted in [phase 1](/manage-school-placements/beta-location-analysis-phase-1/), our selection criteria for high-value areas are biased towards large schools and urban areas. Therefore, while the results are included in the summary table, these characteristics will not be used to evaluate the representativeness of the shortlisted areas.

Birmingham and Tyneside only represent 2 of the 5 characteristics of interest.

Leeds is representative across 4 out of the 5 characteristics of interest.

Leeds is not representative on the ‘Type of Establishment’. ‘Local Authority Maintained Schools’ are over-represented, and ‘Academies’ are under-represented.

[Phase 3](/manage-school-placements/beta-location-analysis-phase-3/) of this analysis explores the potential to improve the sample's representativeness by expanding the sample area.
