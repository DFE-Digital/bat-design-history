## Who we spoke to

We spoke to 9 Initial teacher training (ITT) providers in this round, some of whom were part of the beta and some who had never seen the service before.

The research participants included:

- 4 Universities
- 5 SCITTs, two of whom were national providers
- Of the 9, 3 were trialling our private beta service. 6 were new to the service

## Goals of the research

The goal of user research round 11 was to gain early feedback on two potential concepts that could enhance the Manage school placements service:

The ‘Find a school’ concept which incorporates data on  whether schools have hosted placements for trainee teachers before (from the ‘Register trainee teachers’ service) and data on trained mentors in schools (from the ‘Claim funding for mentor training’ service).

The ‘Generate and promote placements’ concept which:

1. incorporates trainee data from the ‘Manage teacher training applications’ service
2. allows providers to inform schools of the placements they need – both schools they have and have not worked with before.

## What we tested

The 'Find a school' concept consisted of 4 pages with new functionality:

- an updated 'Schools' page
- a 'Find schools' full listing page
- a new 'Find schools' search results page
- an updated 'School listing'.

The ‘Find a school’ concept was tested as a prototype where participants could navigate between different screens in an order of their choosing. They were given the following scenario:

>"We would like you to imagine that you’ve got a candidate for your primary course whose term time address is in South Shields. You don’t currently work with any schools in that area, so you’re looking to find new schools to work with."

The 'Generate and promote placements' concept was tested as a high-level storyboard with explanatory text. Participants saw each image in turn and were asked to give feedback on each step of the process and how they saw it fitting in to existing ways of working.

## Key insights

### Insight 1

Participants felt there was merit in some of the ideas surfaced in both concepts:

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- The ‘find a school’ concept with additional data items on travel time, whether schools have hosted placements before, and mentor details could be useful to help participants decide whether a new school was worth contacting.
- This tallies with feedback obtained from providers in our [recent survey](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-8-and-9-findings/).
- Participants also responded positively to the addition of trainee data within concept 2.
- Most would welcome the functionality to be able to post their placement needs publicly to schools, as long as other providers could not see this information.

> “You’re going to draw from DfE Apply the information of those trainees that have been accepted, so pre-populate those trainees that we have to place? That seems like a very useful way of doing it” - SCITT

> "When we came to using this system, I don’t think we’d go down to the nitty gritty of what the kind of school is. It would need to be: ‘we need a primary school, roughly in this area, what can you show us’. So I think it would be quite basic, the search that we would do at this point. We wouldn’t be able to afford to be picky" - University

### Insight 2

Current ways of working are working:

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- As seen in user research [round 8](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-8-and-9-findings/), providers seem relatively happy with their existing tools and ways of working. They are resistant to change.
- While some participants could see the benefits of our system, particularly when trying to find a new school in an area they had not worked with before, they had concerns about the dual running of systems.
- Providers are very protective of the relationships they have with schools in their network. They have concerns that a centralised digital service for ITT placements  could disrupt the market. They fear ‘losing out’ to other providers if a school could easily work with them.
- Participants also thought the level of commitment was unclear if a school responded to a call out within concept 2.

>" I think it’s just something very new. So I think it’d take a bit of getting used to… I’m always a bit nervous of new systems and schools… don’t like using numerous systems" - University

### Insight 3

Offline communications and communications outside of our service will still exist:

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- Participants, particularly smaller providers talked about the close relationships they have with the schools they work with. They carry out due diligence to ensure both trainee and school have a good experience, intervening when things go wrong.
- There are fears among participants that a centralised digital service could interfere with these established personal relationships, either because other providers will be able to contact schools easily, potentially taking their placements, or because communications would be expected to be held within the service, rather than through existing, potentially offline channels.
- From this round of research, and the research in [round 8](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-8-and-9-findings/), we know our service forms a small part of a much bigger journey. Communications between provider and school will still need to take place outside of this service.

> “Those schools that work with us, we've got really good relationships with and  it's done very much on that personal level. Of course, as soon as you then introduce a generic system, then obviously you run the risk of losing some of that person-ability… It could solve some of our problems because we do have some trainees where we [have to try] to source a placement. [But] I wouldn't want to lose my schools that work with us every year.” - SCITT

### Insight 4

Any new service is only as good as the data within it:

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- Participants expressed concern that the data in our service may not be up to date, particularly if we require schools to update it.
- This is borne out of personal experience: many participants have struggled to contact schools, often getting no response to their emails. They often reported problems with getting schools to keep them up to date with placement offers, despite chasing.
- A big concern related to what would happen if the data in our system did not match the data in theirs.
- Participants also had concerns that school data in the service may not be up to date, or schools could potentially not interact with it at all, limiting its usefulness.

>" My concern would be that schools don’t engage with this or that only some engage with it, and some are outside. If schools don’t engage with this, it will fail" - SCITT

>"If that data was not accurate or was contradicting our data that could cause more work. There’s definitely a lot of potential and things that could work really well, as long as it’s aligned to our systems and processes and not just creating more confusion" - University

## Next steps

As part of this research, we generated a series of 'how might we' statements to help the team think about how we could iterate or improve the service based on user needs. We will run a workshop to prioritise these 'how might we' statements as a team, so we focus on the highest priority items first.

We also plan to iterate and improve our provider personas and user needs, based on the evidence gathered from this round of research and previous rounds.

We are confident from the feedback gathered in this round of testing and the [recent provider survey](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-8-and-9-findings/), that adding relevant data we hold from other DfE services will be useful. We will look to implement this in the existing service as soon as possible.

We will also look to iterate and improve usability issues observed in this round of research, for example:

- providers often missed the tabs at the top of the page when looking to 'find a school' or 'find a placement'
- the 'schools' page could become long and unwieldy if a provider worked with many schools.
