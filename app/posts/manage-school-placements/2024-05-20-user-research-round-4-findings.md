## Who we spoke to

We spoke to 8 support users across 3 separate group research sessions.

The research included:

- 1 paired session with the Head of Operations and Support Team and an Ops and Support Design Manager from the support team
- 2 group sessions each involving 1 Product Liaison Lead and 2 User Support Agents (3 participants per session)

## Goals of the research

The goal user research round 4 was to answer the following questions:

- Do support users understand and are they comfortable with the role they will play in the future service?
- How do support users find the experience of adding a support user to the service and are there any issues they can anticipate?
- How do support users find the experience of adding an organisation to the service and are there any issues they can anticipate?
- Is it clear to support users how they would support ITT provider and school users with any support needs they have?

## What we tested

We tested the ‘Add support user’, ‘Add organisation’ and ‘Add user to an organisation’ journeys as well as getting any general feedback on the overall service.

## Key insights

### Insight 1

It's clear how to use the features available to support users (adding/removing support users, adding organisations and adding/removing organisation users) and these work in a very similar way to other DfE services which is welcomed.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

> “It's easy to navigate, easy to add people, add organisations, remove people. All of that's easy and simple.”

> “It’s really well laid out. It's very similar to Manage and Publish, and I think our agents will find it quite a clear process because it looks the same – the layout of it.”

### Insight 2

Clarity needed on some of the business processes and rules that are part of broader support user journeys.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

For example:

Adding a user to an organisation was straightforward for all participants but they were unsure how they would determine if a user has the right to be added to an organisation before they go into the service to perform that task

For schools that are a lead partner or are attached to a SCITT, it might not be clear what the organisation should be onboarded as (ITT provider or school) so guidance would be helpful on how to determine that

> “In a few clicks I onboarded an organisation but, in real life, more would go into it.”

### Insight 3

Any suggested improvements to the functionality were minor and not essential for day 1 of the Private Beta.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

The following minor changes and potential additions were identified:

- Consider changing the "Users" tab to "Support users" to avoid any ambiguity with the ‘Users’ for an organisation within the service
- Consider adding an edit user feature as this would also benefit support users – although removing and readding users, rather than having the ability to edit, is used on other DfE services
- When adding an ITT provider using 'Add organisation', showing the UK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN) in the autocomplete results would be more useful than seeing the code from the Publish teacher training courses service
- Look at ways to prevent lag issues with the autocomplete field for school/provider names – no results shown when the full name is entered too quickly (although this is common across DfE services so support users can work around it)
- It might be useful to see when a user was added or last active but this need was speculative and would require more evidence to confirm its value

### Insight 4

On the Publish teacher training courses service, there have been issues with having provider partnerships within the service that we could learn from.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

One of the participants mentioned that, in some instances, accredited providers have contacted support saying that they don't work with an organisation that has said they're a lead partner.

## Hypotheses to test

### Hypothesis 1

We think that it should be rare that a school or ITT provider contacts support and asks them to do something on their behalf (as opposed to resolving an issue).

We think this because user research with schools and ITT providers have suggested that they should be able to use these features without the need for support.

We will test this by monitoring the number of support requests that relate to tasks that users have the ability to do them self.

### Hypothesis 2

We think that some schools might potentially contact support if they are added as a partner by an ITT provider they do not recognise.

We think this is because support users have reported this happening on the Publish teacher training courses service.

We will test this by monitoring the number of support tickets that relate to the partner providers feature.
