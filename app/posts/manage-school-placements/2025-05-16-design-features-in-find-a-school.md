# Design feature updates in 'find a school' search for providers

Following on from [concept testing with providers](/manage-school-placements/concept-testing-with-providers/), we launched a version of the ‘Find a school’ search function for provider users ahead of the private beta expansion into Essex.

Providers told us that they think of placements in terms of the school that hosts them, and they establish relationships with them in order to host as many placements as reasonably possible.

The ‘Find a school’ function includes:

- a search page that lists all schools in England
- 4x different style panels on the school search based on the schools hosting status (this data is collected from schools in the [expression of interest flow](/manage-school-placements/expression-of-interest-flow-for-school-users/))
- a ‘placements’ tab consisting of a school’s available and unavailable placements
- a ‘placement information’ tab consisting of a school's contact details and placements hosted in previous years
- a ‘school details’ tab consisting of GIAS information

## Placement information for available placements

When a provider searches for a placement and sees one is available, they will see:

- The number of available placements that can be accessed by a hyperlink
- The number of unavailable placements
- Information on whether the school has hosted placements for trainee teachers previously (this data comes from the Register trainee teachers service)
- Contact information
- Travel information if a location is used in the search

During testing, users found this information was sufficient in finding schools to work with, and users generally understood the flow of clicking through to view further placement details.

## Warning components

For schools that are not hosting placements, we added a warning component to let providers know that the school does not want to be contacted.

For schools that hadn’t yet logged in to the system to share their preferences for hosting, providers see a warning component saying they have not added their details yet.

This decision was made as we wanted to display these schools on the search function so that if a provider was searching in a certain area, they had a complete overview of the schools in the area.

## Status labels

In testing, we found that the status labels we used confused participants. The term ‘host’ was not widely understood to mean that the school has placements available. We changed them from:

- ‘has unfilled placements’ to ‘placements available’ (green)
- ‘open to hosting’ to ‘may offer placements’ (yellow)
- ‘not hosting’ to ‘not offering placements’ (red)

## Updates to the filter

As a result of schools now completing the expression of interest flow, providers can now filter their search by school ‘status’. Providers can also search by when schools last hosted placements.

## ‘Placements’ and ‘placement information’ tabs

Once a user clicks on a school, they can see a complete list of filled and unfilled placements. In testing, this met the participants’ desire to look at the school as a whole and be able to make decisions about the best way to work with the school and reach out about multiple placements.

The user can also see a list of secondary subjects that the school offered previously. This will help the user understand whether there is an opportunity to converse with the school about taking other subjects the school has chosen not to list this year.

## Next steps and further considerations

We will continue to research with providers to check whether the service meets their needs and whether they are able to find appropriate schools to work with.

We are also looking to understand whether there is more that can be done on the provider side to understand and promote the user of the ‘assign provider’ function on the school facing side of the service.

Face-to-face research with providers will take place to understand their use of the service and where we can make improvements.
