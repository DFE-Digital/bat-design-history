Our approach to naming this service followed the convention that ‘[Good services are verbs](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/06/22/good-services-are-verbs-2/)’, in keeping with other DfE teacher recruitment services. For example:

- Publish teacher training courses
- Find postgraduate teacher training
- Apply for teacher training
- Manage teacher training applications
- Register trainee teachers

## Alpha

Towards the end of the alpha phase, we held a ‘namestorming’ workshop to ideate service names. At that time, we envisioned two services: one for schools and one for initial teacher training (ITT) providers.

We listed various possible names, ruled out unsuitable ones, dot-voted, championed their selections and dot-voted again.

Possible names included:

- Find a mentor
- Find a placement
- Find a placement school
- Find an initial teacher training mentor
- Manage initial teacher training mentors
- Manage mentors
- Manage school placements
- Register a mentor

We jointly concluded that we should name the services:

- Manage school placements - for schools
- Find a placement school - for ITT providers

## Private beta

At the start of the private beta, we decided to make the service one service with two different interfaces for school and ITT providers.

We agreed on the service name ‘Manage school placements’ to reflect the multiple actions each user group could carry out – both in the service’s minimum viable product (MVP) form and in recognition of the extensive opportunities for future iteration and development.

Schools can:

- record placements
- manage mentor availability
- list the ITT providers they work with
- assign placements to ITT providers

ITT providers can:

- find placements
- list the schools they work with

We will continue to review the service name throughout the private beta to ensure it aligns with the intention of the service.
