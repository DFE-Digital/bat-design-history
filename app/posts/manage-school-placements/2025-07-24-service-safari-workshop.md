title: "Service Safari Workshop: Testing the End-to-End MSP Experience"
description: Ahead of the launch, the service designer organised a service safari workshop to help the team experience the service as their users would, and to identify potential gaps or problems.

## What we wanted to learn

- What the end-to-end experience of the service is like for users?
- Would it support complex interactions that happen outside the system, like emails and phone calls?
- Would it feel clear and usable from the perspective of schools and providers?

## What we did

A service safari is a research tool where the team uses the service in realistic scenarios to uncover unexpected issues.

Because the service was not yet live, we designed role-play scenarios.

- Teams role-played as a school or provider.
- Each team received a role card with tasks, tools, and behaviours that they had to perform, all based on user research.
- Teams used the newest version of MSP service that was about to launch, as well as emails and phone calls, to organise ITT placements.

We ran two scenarios:

- An ideal case with balanced supply and demand.
- A more challenging case with competition for placements and schools withdrawing.
- After each scenario, teams shared their experiences and discussed what worked and what didn’t.

## What we found

The service worked well in many areas, but we identified some key challenges.

### Provider control over placements

- Using the service made clear that there’s a lot of onus on ‘schools’ to amend and update placements if there was an error or change required in the placement details, and ‘providers’ were also helpless to make these changes themselves. This inspired us to consider exploring options that give providers more control over assigned placements to them.

### Clarity in the user journey

- Some teams uncovered that users could be left feeling uncertain about what to do next after completing particular key steps, especially if the next step was dependent on another user to complete before the participant had to conduct the next step (i.e. a provider waiting for a school to assign a placement to them after discussing it). This could be much more problematic for users that are far less familiar with the service than our team was. This inspired us to consider exploring how we can better sign post what the steps are with the service and manage user uncertainty.

### Functional challenges

- As the teams used the service to complete ITT placement tasks, some teams found that the way in which the service worked didn’t fully align to the process. One example being when searching for a school by name, one team found that the number of schools with a similar name made it difficult to identify the correct school in the workshop. This prompted discussions around including other identifiable elements such as post code as part of the suggested schools in the search bar.

### Technical bugs

- When using the service in a variety of different ways and with many different circumstances, the team identified some unexpected bugs that would occur under very specific circumstances. These technical bugs and how they occurred helped us prioritise fixes for them so that they can’t happen in the launch.

After identifying these different challenges with the service, the service safari was finished with a prioritisation session where a summary of the challenges and bugs were presented and confirmed with the team. The team then prioritised their significance and negotiated who would be responsible for developing a solution to the problems. They were then converted into tickets and added to the backlog.

## Reflections

- The service safari helped the MSP team and participating senior leaders experience the service as school and provider users would.
- The exercise was useful for testing the service in a variety of different scenarios, and encountering technical and functional issues that weren’t discovered from user testing.
- The live service will be monitored to see if any of the experiential challenges and potential user issues encountered on the day are occurring. If they do, they will then become a priority for the design team to address.
