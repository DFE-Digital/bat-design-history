The Manage school placements (MSP) team was preparing to launch an updated version of the service in Essex. Designers and developers were working at pace to deliver new functionality.

Ahead of the launch, our service designer organised a service safari workshop to help the team experience the service as their users would, and to identify potential gaps or problems.

## What we wanted to learn
- What the end-to-end experience of the service is like for users?
- Would it support complex interactions that happen outside the system, like emails and phone calls?
- Would it feel clear and usable from the perspective of schools and providers?

## What we did
A service safari is a research tool where the team uses the service in realistic scenarios to uncover unexpected issues.

Because the service was not yet live, we designed role-play scenarios.

- In smaller groups, the team role played as a school or provider.
- Each group received a role card with tasks, tools, and behaviours that they had to perform, all based on user research.
- The groups used the updated version of the MSP service that was due to launch, as well as emails and phone calls, to organise ITT placements.

We ran two scenarios:

- An ideal case with balanced supply and demand.
- A more challenging case with competition for placements and schools withdrawing.

After each scenario, teams shared their experiences and discussed what worked and what didn’t.

## What we found
The service worked well in many areas, but we identified some key challenges.

### Provider control over placements
- We reflected that the onus was on ‘schools’ to amend and update placements if there was an error or change required in the placement details, and provider users were not empowered to make changes. This made us consider whether we should give providers more control over updating details of placements assigned to them.

### Clarity in the user journey
- Some teams uncovered that users could be left feeling uncertain about what to do next after completing certain steps, especially if the next step was dependent on another user acting first (i.e. a provider waiting for a school to assign a placement to them after discussing it). This could be more problematic for users that are less familiar with the service than our team was. This made us consider how we can signpost next steps better in the service and manage user uncertainty.

### Functional challenges
- Some participants found that organising placements in the service didn’t fully align to the process of organising placements on the ground. For example, when searching for a school by name, one group found that the number of schools with a similar name made it difficult to identify the correct school. This prompted discussions around including other identifiers, such as postcode, in the search bar.

### Technical bugs
- By testing the service in different scenarios, both happy and unhappy paths, the team identified some unexpected bugs that would occur under very specific circumstances. We prioritised fixes for them to ensure a good user experience for launch.

The service safari ended with a prioritisation session in which the team reviewed and prioritise a list of potential challenges and bugs. Each item was converted into a ticket, added to the backlog and assigned an owner.

## Reflections
- The service safari helped the team and participating senior leaders experience the service as school and provider users would.
- The exercise was useful for testing the service in a variety of different scenarios and identifying technical and functional issues that hadn’t been discovered from user testing.
- The live service will be monitored to see if any of the experiential challenges and potential user issues encountered on the day are occurring. If they do, they will then become a priority for the design team to address.
