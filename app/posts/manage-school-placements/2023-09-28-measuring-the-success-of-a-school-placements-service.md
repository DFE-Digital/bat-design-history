Service key performance indicators (KPIs) are generally outcome-based. Following an initial discussion with our data and insights team lead, we will be exploring in more depth the value of measuring:

**A reduction in the number of candidates rejected from an Initial Teacher Training (ITT) course due to placement or mentor issues.**

Apply for teacher training (Apply) offers a “course full” rejection reason, which gives an imprecise but helpful picture of the rate at which eligible candidates are turned away from courses.

Work is being done to increase fidelity within the reasons for rejection field in the Apply service where this information is captured.

**A reduction in trainee withdrawal rate.**

 Work is being done to increase fidelity within the reasons for withdrawal field in the Register service where this information is captured.

**Increasing school participation in ITT.**

We would measure this through the number of distinct school unique reference numbers (URNs) where a mentor was allocated to a trainee.

**Teaching vacancies filled by early career teachers (ECTs).**

Work with Teaching Vacancies to determine where trainees, identified by teacher reference number (TRN), apply for jobs.

**Take-up of the ‘Find a placement school’ service - for example, 50% of the sector.**

We already have complete data on ITT providers, so by looking at outcomes, we can measure the percentage of accredited providers and delivery partners who use this service.

**Take-up of the ‘Manage school placements’ service - for example, 25% of overall schools.**

We can measure how many schools are active on the service compared to the complete list of schools in [Get information about schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/).
