## Who we spoke to

We spoke to 2 school users that were invited to use the service as part of the Private Beta.

The research participants included:

- 1 user from a special school (all-through) that we could see had logged into and used the service
- 1 user from a secondary school that had not logged into the service so would be using it for the first time during the research session

We were originally targeting 5-6 participants for this round but were unable to reach that number because:

- limited uptake and use of the service limited the number of schools we could contact for research
- the schools we were able to contact were busy with the end of the academic year approaching

## Goals of the research

The goal of user research round 6 was to answer the following questions:

- What have schools’ experiences been, so far, using the live service during the Private Beta?
- What changes and improvements should be prioritised from a school perspective?
- Would the addition of an onboarding journey be useful for school users? (testing our design ideas using a prototype)
- Which of the new placement window designs would work best from a school perspective? (using prototype versions of an updated ‘Add placement’ journey)

## What we tested

We reviewed the live Manage school placements service and tested prototype designs for a new onboarding journey and 3 different options for adding placement window into the ‘Add placement’ journey.

## Key insights

### Insight 1

Both participants had low awareness of the service and the benefits of using it were not clear.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

Both participants had not heard about the service until the point that they were contacted with the invite to use it. The invite email focussed on how to access the service but one participant commented that more could have been included on what the service is and the benefit it offers to schools.

> “I do not really know what the purpose of [the service] is or how it’s going to work... There were two different emails. One says ‘invitation to join the Manage school placements service’ and the other one just says ‘start using it’… In the ‘start using it’ one, when it says ‘start adding your placements’ and ‘assigning providers’, to me, that’s something I read and thought that’s for a provider not for me as a school… So all of this [context] has now come out [through the discussion as part of the research session] but actually having some sort of document that explains this might be useful just to provide a bit of background.”

### Insight 2

Because they are unsure of the benefits, ITT providers are not currently promoting use of the service with their partner schools for the Private Beta and this affects school awareness and engagement.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

We know from [user research round 7](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-7-findings/) that ITT providers are continuing to use their existing methods for capturing placement information rather than encouraging use of the new service. We heard an example of how this affects school engagement from one of the participants in user research round 6. The school user contacted their ITT provider to ask whether they could share any further information about the service but the provider was unable to offer support.

> “So essentially the email [inviting our school to use the service] came from the DfE and I got back to one of the providers and said ‘Oh, where’s this come from? What do I need to do with this?’ and they went ‘Not a clue – it’s all the DfE’ so I just parked it.”

### Insight 3

For all-through schools that see the education phase screen when adding a placement, there’s potential for this screen to be misinterpreted as a question about the school rather than the individual placement.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

When going through the ‘Add placement’ journey, the participant from an all-through special school thought that the education phase screen was asking what type of school the placement was for rather than the question being about the individual placement itself. All-through schools are shown the education phase screen because they can create primary or secondary placements.

### Insight 4

It was unclear to the special school participant that we spoke to whether special schools were or were not in scope for the service – the features they used within the service did not seem to reference or acknowledge their circumstances.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

The participant from a special school expected to see a question or some information within the service referencing that they are a special school and acknowledging how that affects their placements. For secondary placements at the participant’s special school, the subject options shown within the service were not relevant because their secondary classes are structured around key stage like their primary classes. Across both primary and secondary, their key stage-based classes include mixed year groups so they also need the ability to select multiple year groups for a single placement where relevant.

### Insight 5

It’s easy to end up in a dead-end unhappy path when creating a DfE Sign-in account before entering the service.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

If a user does not have a DfE Sign-in account when attempting to log in to the Manage school placements service, they are directed to create an account using DfE Sign-in. After creating an account using DfE Sign-in, users are taken back to a login screen which, after logging in, takes them to DfE Sign-in account management screens rather than redirecting them to the Manage school placements service.

One of the participants in this round experienced this issue and was under the impression that the DfE Sign-in account management screen was part of the Manage school placements service. We expect that more users will experience this issue when creating a DfE Sign-in account before entering the service.

This is an issue for other DfE services, such as Claim funding for mentor training, and it’s unclear whether there’s a reason that users are not redirected back to the service they were using before entering the DfE Sign-in account creation journey.

### Insight 6

Both participants were positive about the onboarding prototype design and found the structure of a list useful but it was not considered an essential change.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

Structuring the onboarding steps into a task list was felt to provide a clear approach but neither participant had issues completing the same steps without that additional structure so, compared to other changes required within the service, it was not considered to be a priority.

> “I think the way that it was already set up worked. It’s not a complex system, particularly, is it? So I do not think, unless [the DfE] want things to be completed in a certain order, then I do not think there’s a need to change to this [new design]. This [task list] certainly makes you complete things in a certain order because it’s a list and humans will work down a list.”

### Insight 7

Both participants favoured the use of academic terms (placement window option 1) to capture the placement window as part of the ‘Add placement’ journey.

![Placement window option 1: academic terms](terms.png "Placement window option 1: academic terms")

![Placement window option 2: months](months.png "Placement window option 2: months")

![Placement window option 3: date range](specific-dates.png "Placement window option 3: date range")

#### Supporting detail and evidence

Although different schools can use different terminology to refer to the academic terms (e.g. some schools use term 1, 2 and 3 rather than Autumn, Spring and Summer) and the term dates will vary by school, academic term (placement window option 1) was considered by both participants to be the best way to provide an initial indication of when the placement could take place to narrow down the conversation with providers without adding additional effort for schools to provide detailed date information.

The academic terms approach was also tested in [user research round 1](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-1-findings/), where we learnt that restricting the selection using radio buttons did not work but the new design with checkboxes resolved that issue.

Using months (placement window option 2) was considered an acceptable alternative but would take more time for school users to enter and would not remove the need to still have a follow up conversation with ITT providers to discuss more specific dates.

Using date ranges (placement window option 3) was felt to add unnecessary extra effort to adding a placement because schools often would not have specific start and end dates in mind (without discussing these with a provider) and their capacity might not always be in consecutive periods (e.g. they might have capacity in the Autumn and Summer terms but not in the Spring term).

## Hypotheses to test

### Hypothesis 1

We think that most schools (that are already involved in ITT) will require encouragement or instruction from their ITT providers to use the service.

We think this because the existing behaviour for most schools is to wait until an ITT provider instructs them to do something and, as found in [user research round 1](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-1-findings/) and [user research round 3](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-3-findings/), schools with existing provider relationships are unlikely to use the service if it adds to rather than replaces existing effort providing placement information.

We will test this by doing more research with schools that have not used the service during the Private Beta to understand the barriers.

### Hypothesis 2

We think that the secondary subjects list is not relevant to special schools.

We think this because the special school we spoke to in this round do not use subjects to structure their secondary classes and it would make sense if other special schools follow a similar approach.

We will test this by doing more research with special schools and understanding any other class models that exist.

### Hypothesis 3

We think that a high percentage of users without an existing DfE Sign-in account will experience an unhappy path when creating an account before entering the service.

We think this because a participant in this round experienced the issue and it’s also been reported for the Claim funding for mentor training service which has a similar school user group.

We will test this by monitoring support tickets related to this issue and by conducting further research to understand the onboarding experience of school users that do not have an existing DfE Sign-in account.
