## Who we spoke to

We spoke to the 5 initial teacher training (ITT) providers and 1 teaching school hub that will participate in the Private Beta that will launch on 13th June.

The research participants included:

- 2 higher education institutions (HEIs), 3 school-centred (SCITTs) and 1 teaching school hub (TSH) that are set to take part in the Private Beta in Leeds
- 3 paired sessions to get the perspectives of different roles within the same ITT provider

## Goals of the research

The goal of user research round 5 was to answer the following questions:

- Are there any significant gaps in the service that need to be addressed before the launch of the Private Beta?
- Have the iterations made to the ‘Find placements’ journey addressed the user feedback from [user research round 2](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-2-findings/)?
- What placement management functionality is needed by ITT providers?
- Does the concept of having partner schools within the service make sense to ITT providers and what features are most valuable in relation to partner schools?

## What we tested

We tested the next iteration of the ‘Find placements’ journey as well as getting general feedback on the overall service and its value to ITT providers.

## Key insights

### Insight 1

The Placements tab should be the starting point when an ITT provider user logs into the service and it should show the available placements only by default.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

In the demo version of the service that was tested, the starting point was the Organisation details tab but all of the participants felt that it should be Placements tab. ITT providers are, more often than not, going into the service to find placements so the Placements tab is where they would go first the majority of the time.

Participants said that they might occasionally have the need to view placements that have already been assigned but, the majority of the time, they would only want to see the placements that are still available so available placements should be shown by default on the Placements tab with the option to include unavailable placements if needed.

### Insight 2

ITT providers need the ability to input their contact details into the school placements service rather than relying on the contact details from the Publish teacher training courses service.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

For larger ITT providers, the point of contact for placements is different to the contact for training courses. So pulling the ITT provider contact details through from the Publish teacher training courses service does not work for these providers (3 out of the 5 providers we spoke to in this round).

### Insight 3

It was clear to participants what the Placements tab was showing and how to use the search and filter options available but there are some significant gaps: education phase, year group for primary placements and placement window.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

Although the subject filter can be used to limit a placement search to primary or secondary only, the participants felt that this should be made easier by adding an education phase filter as this is a fundamental distinction when searching for placements.

For primary school placements, ITT providers need to know which year group the placement is in to determine whether it’s suitable for their trainee. So not capturing this would lead to irrelevant enquiries.

For all placements, the placement window is also considered to be critical information to avoid contacting a school unnecessarily. Participants said that showing the term or having a date range could work although there wasn’t a clear consensus on the best approach to take.

> “The search and being able to filter things, it all looks pretty user friendly... I think they're clear, the filters make sense, but they're not necessarily ones that we'd need to use or that would be the most important ones... I'd like to filter by key stage or subject first. Once I've done that, when I look at the list that comes up, what I really need is to see that they are offering a placement from this date to this date and the number of students they can take.”

### Insight 4

The purpose and user benefit of the partner schools feature was not clear to some participants.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

The participants understood what was meant by ‘Partner schools’ but it wasn’t language they would necessarily use and it was not intuitive how and why these partnerships are added into the service:

- one participant assumed that DfE would use data from other services to create the partnerships
- participants from larger ITT providers were concerned about the need to add these relationships into the service one at a time as they have hundreds of partner schools

> “I would understand [partner schools] as schools that we have worked with for placements in previous years or the current year. Rather than specifically ones that are part of our trust, which is a much smaller number... And how much history would you be able to pull back on that because it was only since 22-23 that we've given placement information on the DfE [service]?”

> “Within our system [Abyasa], we add schools from the UK list and we've got over 1,000 and they're all in there as a 'partner school'. It doesn’t mean we work with them. It means we have contacted them and we've got their details. We don’t award any schools partnership or partner status really… If they do offer that year then we’re partners with them for that year and we do sign a partnership agreement. But in the practicalities of sorting placements we don’t really consider that.”

> “Is [adding partner schools] something you have to do on an individual school by school basis or is there a way of doing it in bulk? Because obviously we'd be adding hundreds of schools if we were to do it that way. It would be quite a big job for us... and I'm not sure what added benefit we're getting because we know who our schools are and we know who's signed what they've signed and how they've signed it.”

### Insight 5

The ability to sort placement search results by location is valued and travel time would be a significant addition.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

In line with the findings from [user research round 2](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-2-findings/), participants stressed that travel time plays a significant role when matching trainees with a placement. Straight-line distances provide an indication of what the travel time might be but displaying travel time information, for car and public transport, would save ITT providers the task of needing to work this out separately.

Ordering the placement search results using the distance or travel time seemed to remove the need to set a search radius which was raised by multiple participants in [user research round 2](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-2-findings/).

### Insight 6

The preferred order of the filters was individual to each provider but ‘establishment group’ was deemed non-essential by all. Balancing those different perspectives, the most suitable filter order based on the participants' expected frequency of use and logical groupings is (from top to bottom):

- Placements to show (available placements only, all placements or those assigned to the provider) with 'available placements only' selected by default
- Education phase (when added as a filter)
- Subject
- Year group (when added as a filter)
- Placement window (when added as a filter)
- Partner schools
- Schools
- Establishment group (this can be removed, if needed, as more filters are added)

#### Supporting detail and evidence

The participants said that they would, in most cases, use the service to find new placements so only the available placements should be shown by default. Although it is still useful to have the option, if needed, to see placements that are no longer available or that have been assigned to them.

Education phase is a fundamental distinction when searching for placements so this was suggested as a new filter that should be added at the top. Subject, year group and placement window are the other filters the participants could see themselves using frequently and this order reflect how the information is captured within the ‘Add placement’ journey.

Participants expected that they would use the partner schools and schools filters less often but they were useful options to have for rarer scenarios.

All of the participants said that they would rarely use the establishment group filter if at all so, as more filters are added, this can be removed to make space for other filters that are more useful.

This new filter order is suggested as a starting point, based on the research done so far, but should be revisited as part of future research after the service goes live.

## Hypotheses to test

### Hypothesis 1

We think that providers will struggle to add all of their partner schools into the service and keep this information up to date.

We think this because participants have had questions or concerns about this feature in most of the research sessions in this round and [user research round 2](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-2-findings/).

We will test this by monitoring how partnerships are used during the Private Beta and understanding ITT providers experiences through more user research.

### Hypothesis 2

We think that this filter order (top to bottom) balances the needs of different providers:

- Placements to show
- Education phase (when added as a filter)
- Subject
- Year group (when added as a filter)
- Placement window (when added as a filter)
- Partner schools
- Schools

We think this because, from our perspective, it combines what we learnt about the participants’ expected frequency of use and logical groupings.

We will test this by using data analytics to monitor how the filters are used after the service goes live and revisit the order as part of future research with providers.

### Hypothesis 3

We think that ordering placement search results by distance removes the need to set a radius when searching for a placement using a location.

We think this because the need to set a search radius was raised by multiple participants in [user research round 2](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-2-findings/) but the participants from this round were satisfied by the results being sorted by distance.

We will test this by monitoring if the need to set a search radius is raised in future user research as part of the Private Beta.
