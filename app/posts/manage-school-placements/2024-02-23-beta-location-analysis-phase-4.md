## Leeds-area representativeness

The accuracy of our performance analysis relies on the representativeness of establishment types within our selected area. In Leeds:

- the over-representation of local authority maintained schools could lead to results that disproportionately reflect their behaviours and performance patterns

- the underrepresentation of academies risks missing key trends and behaviours specific to this type of establishment, which could be critical to comprehensive analysis

To mitigate these risks, it is essential to:

- recognise and account for the potential skew in data due to the over-representation of local authority maintained schools

- ensure that the performance of academies is carefully examined to uncover any distinct trends

## Representativeness of academies in Leeds

This table shows that academy placement schools in Leeds represent the wider academy placement school population.

| Characteristics | Leeds academies |
| --- | --- |
| Number of pupils | ✓ Representative of wider population |
| Urban-rural setting | ❌ Not representative of wider population |
| Percentage of free school meals | ✓ Representative of wider population |
| Phase of education | ✓ Representative of wider population |
| Ofsted rating | ✓ Representative of wider population |
| Religious character | ✓ Representative of wider population |

The results show that academies in Leeds are representative across all the characteristics of interest.

Therefore, we can assume that the trends observed in Leeds academies will broadly represent the wider population.

## Conclusion

Leeds offers the best balance between value and representativeness.

The only characteristic of interest that Leeds is not representative of is ‘Establishment Type’. Within Leeds, local authority maintained schools are overrepresented and academies are underrepresented.

Sub-group analysis demonstrates that the Academies in Leeds represent the wider population, so the trends observed in this sub-population are likely to accurately represent Academies across England.

Performance analysis should account for the disproportionate impact of ‘LA maintained schools’ on the sample.

Placement schools in Leeds are predominantly (85%) in ‘Major Urban Conurbations’. If it is expected that ‘urban cities and towns’ or rural schools will behave differently in relation to the service, then the extension to this analysis should be considered.
