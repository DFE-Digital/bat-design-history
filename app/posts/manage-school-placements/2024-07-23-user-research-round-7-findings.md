## Who we spoke to

We spoke to the 5 initial teacher training (ITT) providers and 1 teaching school hub that are participating in the Private Beta. These are the same organisations we spoke to in [user research round 5](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-5-findings/) before the service went live on 13th June.

The research participants included:

- 2 higher education institutions (HEIs), 3 school-centred (SCITTs) and 1 teaching school hub (TSH) that are taking part in the Private Beta in Leeds
- 2 paired sessions to get the perspectives of different roles within the same ITT provider

## Goals of the research

The goal of user research round 7 was to answer the following questions:

- What have ITT providers' experiences been, so far, using the live service during the Private Beta?
- Have the iterations made to the ‘find placements’ journey addressed the user feedback from [user research round 5](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-5-findings/)?
- What other changes and improvements should be prioritised from an ITT provider perspective?
- Which potential uses of trainee data within the service have the greatest potential to be useful for ITT providers? (testing our design ideas using prototypes)

## What we tested

We reviewed the live Manage school placements service and tested concept prototypes demonstrating different ways that trainee data could potentially be used within the service as a future enhancement.

## Key insights

### Insight 1

Providers use of the service has been limited so far primarily because of the limited number of placements that have been added by schools.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

Factors affecting school engagement based on provider findings from this round and school findings from [user research round 6](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-6-findings/):

- Timing of the launch – the service went live after most providers had already requested placement capacity (between April and May) so adding their capacity into the service would duplicate effort for schools at a busy point in the year
- Awareness issue – many schools are still unaware of the service or do not understand what it is and the benefits of using it
- Service requires schools to adopt new behaviours – e.g. schools tend to respond to provider requests and chasing rather than provide their capacity proactively; if schools do offer their capacity proactively, they would approach their existing providers before offering placements to others
- ITT providers are not currently promoting use of the service – the providers we’ve spoken to in Leeds are content with their current ways of working and are concerned that this new approach could jeopardise their existing relationships with schools

> “It’s difficult to give feedback on the actual platform when we're not fully using it… I personally think, for it to be used wholesale, it needs to be the go to and it's really hard to get a mindset shift… It’s security for everybody and there’s that nervousness that we can see other providers’ placements, they can see ours and I think it's a big mindset shift.”

### Insight 2

The updated order and labels for the Placement tab filters made sense to all of the participants following changes made after [user research round 5](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-5-findings/).

#### Supporting detail and evidence

There are some additional filtering needs that are not yet satisfied (education phase and placement window) but the filters that are currently available are clear and ordered in a way that reflects what the participants said they would use most often.

### Insight 3

The primary year group filter design satisfied the needs participants have but incorporating mixed year groups also need to be considered.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

Participants said it was important to know if a primary placement will be in a mixed year group class because it might affect whether the placement will meet the criteria for the teaching qualification. For example: if the trainee needs to complete a key stage 1 placement as part of their qualification, the provider needs to ensure that enough pupils within a mixed year 2 and year 3 class are the age level required for key stage 1.

### Insight 4

3 out of the 5 participants we spoke to in this round favoured or were content with academic terms being used to capture placement window – in line with what we heard from schools in [user research round 6](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-6-findings/)

#### Supporting detail and evidence

Knowing the terms that the school has placement capacity in sufficiently narrows down the options so that the provider can then have a conversation with the school to discuss specific dates. 2 of the participants from this round favoured the use of date ranges to capture the placement window but this approach tested poorly with schools in [user research round 6](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-6-findings/).

### Insight 5

Out of the 5 trainee data concepts we tested (demonstrating different ways that trainee data could potentially be used within the service), concepts 4 and 5 were the most appealing so are worth developing further.

[Screenshot of Frieda Jackson trainee details screen with description “Concept 4: Using trainee data to enable the service to proactively bring new placements to the provider's attention (within the service or via notifications)”]

[Screenshot of placements tab within partner schools screens (Whitburn Church of England School example) with description “Concept 5: Providing an overview screen with all placements offered by a partner school”]

#### Supporting detail and evidence

Having to regularly return to the service to check whether new placements have been added is considered an inefficient approach. So all the participants were positive about concept 4 and anything that can be done to proactively bring new placements to the provider's attention. There were mixed views on whether email notifications would be the best approach or whether these new placements should be highlighted within the service. Further design iteration and testing is needed to determine the best way to deliver against this need.

As found in [user research round 2](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-2-findings/) and [user research round 5](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-5-findings/), providers need to have a ‘school view’ of placement capacity as well as the ability to look at individual placements in isolation. Seeing all the placements being offered by a single school on an overview screen, as shown in concept 5, was received positively by all participants. However, in addition, we should still look at ways to bring a ‘school view’ into the ‘Find placement’ journey without the need to get this information by separately visiting the Partner schools tab – this was described as “long winded” by one of the participants.

The participants’ feedback on concepts 1 and 2 was mixed. Using trainee data to manage the placement allocation process and speed up the placement search process could streamline parts of the process but does not offer a significant benefit over how this information is currently managed and the current designs do not reflect the fluid nature of how placements are assigned. For example: providers tend to identify placements before they know who the trainee will be and, as the list of trainees is confirmed, trainees are pencilled in against these placements. The picture constantly changes and trainees are reallocated as providers build a full picture of their trainees and placements for the year. Multiple providers referred to this process as “a big jigsaw”.

All of the providers in this round felt that concept 3 (sharing trainee data with the placement school) did not fit with how they currently work. They were uncomfortable with sharing trainee application information with the placement school as there were concerns about selection bias and GDPR.

## Hypotheses to test

### Hypothesis 1

We think that, on balance, using academic terms will work best as the first iteration of incorporating placement windows into the service.

We think this because both of the schools we spoke to in [user research round 6](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-6-findings/) and 3 out of the 5 providers we spoke to in this round favoured or were comfortable with that approach.

We will test this by conducting more user research on this addition after it is introduced to the Private Beta service.

### Hypothesis 2

We think that most schools will not use the service unless ITT providers encourage or instruct them to.

We think this because the existing behaviour for most schools is to wait until an ITT provider instructs them to do something and, as found in [user research round 1](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-1-findings/) and [user research round 3](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-3-findings/), schools with existing provider relationships are unlikely to use the service if it adds to rather than replaces existing effort providing placement information.

We will test this by doing more research with schools that have not used the service during the Private Beta to understand the barriers.

### Hypothesis 3

We think that ordering placement search results using travel time might remove the need to display the school postcode on each placement within the Placements tab.

We think this because our understanding is that the postcode would be used to find the travel time using a map tool so providing this information within the service might remove the need to perform that separate task.

We will test this by retesting the Placements tab screen after travel time is introduced and checking whether seeing the school postcode for each placement would still be beneficial to providers.
