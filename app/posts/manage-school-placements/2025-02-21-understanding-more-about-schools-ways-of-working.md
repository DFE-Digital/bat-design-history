## Who we spoke to

In round 10 we spoke to 16 school leaders from around the country. Two had experience of using the private beta service, the rest had not used our service before. The participants were:

- 8 schools who offer placements each year. These ranged schools who offer low volumes of placements (less than 5 per year) to those who offer high volumes of placements (up to 50 per year).
- 8 schools who are not offering placements now. As part of this group, we spoke to two who had never offered placements and 6 who used to offer but have not done so for over 2 years.

## Goals of the research

Our goals for this round were to:

- Build a better picture of how schools who offer placements operate so we can understand where our service might fit into existing processes.
- Understand how they make decisions on whether to offer Initial teacher Training (ITT) placements and which provider to work with.
- Learn about the characteristics of schools who are not currently offering placements.
- Understand the reasons why they do not offer, and identify any barriers they have, which we could help mitigate.

## Key insights

### Insight 1

Different ways of working amongst ITT providers can prevent schools from offering placements

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- Providers tend to have different placement dates. Each provider asks schools to use their own systems to track progress and submit final reports when mentoring.
- This makes it harder for schools to work with multiple providers. Mentors must learn new systems and processes for each provider. Schools often have to run multiple induction days and end up repeating training days as each provider's cohort joins them.
- Because of this, some schools have taken the decision to limit the number of providers they work with or only work with specific providers in each department. This means their mentors only have to remember one way of doing things.
- Only three schools in this round were considering working with new providers. The others preferred to work with the same providers year on year as they were familiar with their chosen provider’s ways of working.

> On managing multiple placements with multiple providers: "It's time consuming and tricky. It very much relies on the providers being really good communicators, which we're lucky that they are. We rely on them to make sure we know what's happening when and what's expected of us when, rather than us having to dictate that..." - Engaged secondary school

> " If you've got a mentor that is mentoring two different people from two different providers, it does get a little bit ‘what am I doing in which, which platform am I using for this one?’" - Engaged secondary school

> " The one thing I wish was standardised was the placement dates. When you work with more than one provider, they all start at different times. We run induction... we repeat ourselves a lot. Sometimes it would be brilliant if they all just stuck to the same dates... it wouldn't matter which provider, you could induct all the trainees at the same time." - Engaged secondary school

### Insight 2

Schools responded positively to the idea of a centralised system to log placements

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- When our service was described to schools, they felt the main benefit would be the ability to log placements in one place, rather than using different methods for each provider.
- The service would need to allow for current behaviours, for example being able to allocate placements to specific providers or waiting for their preferred provider to get back to them before casting the net wider.
- To some, the process seemed familiar as they already use a portal to log placements for the Universities they work with.
- However, two indicated that they were not using the University portals before the deadline, preferring to communicate by email.

> “I think it would be nice to have it all in one place rather than me filling in three different forms for the different providers, which is what I have been doing. If it was just one form that would make my life a bit easier, definitely" - Engaged secondary school

> " I can see massive benefits… I found it very easy to use" - Engaged primary school who had taken part in our Beta

### Insight 3

In this cohort, most ‘disengaged’ schools had experience with ITT.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- Despite our best efforts with recruitment, we only managed to speak to two schools who had never offered placements. Six of our "disengaged" schools had offered ITT in the past but had chosen not to during the last 2+ years, due to staff instability or working to improve their Ofsted rating.
- This means they already had a reasonably good idea of what ITT is and what it involves from a school’s side.
- Only one participant had limited interaction with ITT in the past. They had questions around the various routes, whether their school would have to pay trainees and the specifics of offering placements.

> "Although we spoke to the Unis and they would have quite happily still sent students, our workload was such that there was so much pressure on teachers. We just felt that it was another layer of responsibility to their already really busy timetable so we didn't really feel it would have been fair on our teachers, but also on the students that were coming in as well..." - Primary school who was no longer offering placements after an Ofsted Requires Improvement grading

> "[We need] to get that clear communication with the providers about everything ITT entails so we can make an informed decision about whether we've got the capacity at the school to do it or not" - Primary school who was unfamiliar with ITT

### Insight 4

Special schools are not being offered placements. They highlighted gaps in ITT provision

#### Supporting detail and evidence

- Many schools spoke about a rise in pupils with Special education needs disabilities (SEND) and Education, Help and Care Plans (EHCPs) in their settings post-Covid.
- Some participants told us about their own teacher training and said it had not prepared them for the realities of the role. They believed inexperience working with pupils with SEND can lead to poor staff mental health and ultimately teachers exiting the profession.
- Headteachers of special schools said more is needed to prepare trainee teachers for the realities of teaching pupils with SEND. Providers were not reaching out to them about placements longer than a day or two.
- They believed more emphasis is needed on SEND in ITT and that this could be having an impact on retention.

> "Some of [our] classes would present quite a high level of need or challenge, whether that's behaviour or SEND. So we felt that… it wasn't really very fair to put new teachers or training teachers into that... the amount of children that we are holding mean that… in most classes we have one or two children that are sort of out of the realms of a typical kind of class" - Primary special school not offering placements

> " There's going to be more and more and more kids every year coming through the system with EHCPs, which means they need people who get these kids and can support them to be the best they can." - Headteacher of a special needs school

## Next steps

Doing this research has given our team a greater understanding about how both 'engaged' and 'disengaged' schools operate. It has allowed us to refresh our user needs for schools and iterate our existing personas to focus on the needs, goals and behaviours of "engaged", "disengaged" and SEND schools.

A more comprehensive understanding of our users will help us develop the Manage school placements service to better meet the needs of schools.

Our team are now defining and designing a series of concepts which aim to give schools functionality to get involved with ITT if they have not done so before, or make it easier to add placements for those who do. They will be tested with schools in future rounds of research. These include:

- Allowing schools to ‘express their interest’ in ITT without committing to hosting.
- Assigning placements to preferred providers.
- Enabling Multi Academy Trust level access.
- Highlighting special schools, to spotlight them as good placement options.  s
