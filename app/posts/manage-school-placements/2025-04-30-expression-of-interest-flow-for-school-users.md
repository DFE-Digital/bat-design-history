From our research in [round 10](/manage-school-placements/understanding-more-about-schools-ways-of-working/?), we understood that schools needed a way to express their interest in hosting trainee teachers without committing to specific placements due to uncertainties around capacity and resourcing and potential for last minute change. We also discovered that schools wanted a way to opt out and not be contacted or contacted too much.

## Testing the ‘expression of interest’ concept

In round 12 and round 14, we tested the concept of schools being able to express their interest by allowing school users to set a status. We were particularly interested in understanding the use of the ‘interested in hosting’ status. This did not feature any details about what placements schools may be able to potentially host, but allowed us to understand the users appetite for declaring they are interested without committing to offer specific placements.

We also sought to understand the use of a status which would inform providers which schools are not hosting placements at all.

We found that although the concept was generally welcomed, the participants felt for the ‘interested’ status, that their journey was incomplete by not being able to communicate their preferences for potentially hosting placements in more detail. Some participants mentioned they wouldn’t want to receive irrelevant emails about placements they know they couldn’t accommodate.

The iteration we launched mimicked the current flow we had for bulk adding placements, however offered much more flexibility to answer ‘I don’t know’ to some of the questions about placement availability. You can read more about concept testing in a future user research design history.

The rest of the design history outlines design elements from the private beta launched in Essex.

## Users express their interest using 3 options

Through multiple iterations and concept testing with schools, we launched a new onboarding flow.

When users onboard to the service, or at the start of a new academic year, they will be presented with a question about their ability to offer placements.

School users are presented with 3 options: yes, no and maybe. If the school knows the placements they want to offer, they can record them. If they don’t know exactly, they can highlight to providers what they may be open to offering in a way that doesn’t commit them to specific placements or to one provider. If they are not hosting placements, they can select the reason why.

In each flow we collect the schools preferred contact details. This is one person who would be the placement contact. If they are not offering placements, we collect an email to ask them again next year whether their circumstances have changed and whether they can offer.

This new onboarding function allows much more flexibility for schools and caters for a wider range of needs than the service previously did. This expression of interest flow allows any school, not just those who are definitely offering placements for trainee teachers, to use the service and share information with ITT providers.

## The ’yes’ journey – a bulk upload process

To speed up the ability for users to move through the initial onboarding process, we added the function to bulk add placements at once. Users add:

- the education phase
- a secondary school subject, a primary year group or SEND setting
- The number of placements in each phase of education

The ‘check your answers’ page shows the structure of how the data is captured. Users can add further preferences to their placements later, such as term date, mentor and provider.

We know that schools are busy, so adding the ability to onboard quickly will encourage participation in the service.

## A ‘maybe’ journey for flexibility

Schools users might click the ‘maybe’ option if they are:

- flexible with trainees they can take and want to hear what providers can offer
- have a rough idea of subjects or year groups they’d like placements in
- do not yet know their capacity for hosting but know they want to host something
- new to hosting and want to hear what is available from different providers

These users can now clearly express their intent while making it clear they aren’t committed to hosting a particular set placements. Each time they are asked a question about their preferences they are given an option to say ‘I don’t know’, and no information is stored against the question. Information is displayed to providers as ‘potential placement’ information, rather than a list of placement offers.

## Ability to share additional information during the 'maybe’ journey

Users taking the ‘maybe’ path are more likely to either have questions for the providers or want to tell them specific things about their school. We added the question “Is there anything about your school you would like the providers to know? (optional)” with an open text box to users can fill in.

We will monitor this function and evaluate whether this facilitates smoother communication with providers about placement opportunities. We will also monitor this function to see whether there is value in adding this feature to those who select ‘yes’ to recording their placements.

## A ‘no’ journey for data capture

If users select ‘no - I can’t offer placements’ they are then asked:

- the reason for not being able to participate
- whether we can contact them in the next academic year to ask again

This leads to vital data capture for DfE as to the reasons a school is not participating. As well as this, it gives us an opportunity to try and reengage them in school placements in the next academic year.

## Confirmation screens instead of success banners

We found while testing concepts that it was less clear to users where they were in their journey of expressing their interest to providers. They had completed their preferences, but some were not clear what would happen next, or what has happened because of them expressing their interest. For this reason we added confirmation screens to the end of each journey, rather than following our usual pattern of using success banners.

We will continue to monitor users understanding of the over process as well as add further features, such as emails, to support users understanding of next steps.

## Next steps and considerations

We will continue to test these new iterations through the public beta service and improve them based on feedback from schools and providers.

We are looking to understand the performance of the ‘amber pathway’ journey and whether this meets the users' needs around expressing their interest in a way that doesn’t commit them to specific placements too early on. Observational research will take place with users to watch them using the service for the first time (round 15).

We have considered whether the functionality for schools to add additional information (in an open text box) in the ‘maybe’ journey should be replicated in the ‘yes’ journey. We will review this and introduce it if users find it helpful.

We have made improvements so that school users can record SEND-specific placements. We will monitor use of this new functionality and improve it in line with user feedback.
