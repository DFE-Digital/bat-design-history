During [live observations with schools using our service](https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/manage-school-placements/live-observations-with-schools), we found that sometimes participants were not confident about what action to take. This mainly occurred after participants had completed the [expression of interest flow](https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/manage-school-placements/expression-of-interest-flow-for-school-users). Participants in the [service safari workshop](https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/manage-school-placements/service-safari-workshop) also identified a need to help users understand their next steps.

For this reason, we added information to the service to help users understand what steps to take after completing the expression of interest flow. As set out in this design history, the changes included new content in the service to let school users know when they need to wait for providers to contact them, as well as confirmation emails to school users when they have completed certain tasks. These snippets were added to both the provider view and the school view of the service.

This design history details the specific copy changes we made to the service as a result of these findings.

## Wayfinding improvements to provider view of service

For the provider view of the service, we added the line ‘Email this school if you have suitable trainees’ across the top section of school details pages. We also renamed the ‘Placement information’ tab to ‘Contact’, to ensure complete clarity on where users should go to see the contact details.
