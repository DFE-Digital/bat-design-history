We investigated the value of adding an additional region to our sample to improve the overall representativeness.

## Expanding the sample area

We considered 2 approaches for expanding the sample area:

1. Expand into an adjacent local area
2. Expand into a separate rural region

### Expanding into an adjacent local area

The advantage of expanding into an adjacent local area is that it streamlines expansion by utilising onboarded provider-school networks.

The drawback of expanding into an adjacent local area is that the surrounding areas are heavily urban, so there is limited improvement in rural-urban representativeness.

### Expanding into a separate rural region

Expanding into a separate rural region has the advantage of potentially diversifying and improving rural-urban classification representativeness.

The drawback of expanding into a separate rural region is that it increases the resources required to onboard a new area.

## Focus on expanding into an adjacent local area

We decided to focus on expanding to an adjacent local area.

Engaging with local ecosystems is critical for a successful beta. By engaging with an adjacent local area, we can expand within the same networks already using the service.

Our strategy will target the networks of current provider partners (providers located in our beta sample region). This will help us target our extension into areas within existing service user networks and optimise our chances of success by building on proven relationships.

If evidence suggests rural schools will interact differently with our service, future expansion into rural areas will be explored.

## Birmingham-based providers expanded network

In general, providers in Birmingham operate across a wide area. This will be partially influenced by how we have classified the location of SCITTs, as some regional providers have the most placement school partners in Birmingham.

Upon investigating the potential of these areas to improve Birmingham's representativeness, we chose Sandwell as the most appropriate region. Staffordshire placement schools had similar characteristics to Birmingham.

| Local authority | Number of providers in the area | Number of placements schools in the area |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Birmingham | 12 | 333 |
| Staffordshire CC | 9 | 78 |
| Sandwell | 7 | 77 |
| Solihul | 8 | 55 |
| Dudley | 4 | 55 |
| Warwickshire CC | 8 | 52 |
| Worcestershire CC | 6 | 47 |
| Walsall | 7 | 44 |
| Wolverhampton | 6 | 41 |

### Birmingham and Sandwell

Including both Birmingham and Sandwell in the sample area does not improve the representativeness of any characteristics compared to Birmingham alone. Birmingham's large placement school population is likely a critical factor in this result, as it will require a sizeable contrasting placement school population to improve the representativeness meaningfully. If we choose Birmingham, we should consider multiple areas for expansion.

| Characteristic | Representative across all categories | Representative across categories of interest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pupil numbers | No | Not applicable |
| Urban-rural setting | No | No |
| Percentage of free school meals | No | Not applicable |
| Establishment type | Yes | Yes |
| Phase of education | No | Yes |
| Ofsted rating | No | No |
| Religious character | No | No |

## Leeds-based providers expanded network

All the providers in Leeds also operate in Bradford, Calderdale, and Kirklees, so these are both excellent options for a second region.

Bradford has many placement schools that are ‘Academies’, so this region has the best potential to improve the representativeness of the Leeds Placement schools.

| Local authority | Number of providers in the area | Number of placements schools in the area |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Leeds | 6 | 217 |
| Bradford | 6 | 137 |
| Calderdale and Kirklees | 6 | 104 |
| Wakefield | 3 | 82 |
| North Yorkshire CC | 4 | 71 |
| Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham | 5 | 33 |
| East Riding of Yorkshire | 2 | 10 |
| Sheffield | 2 | 7 |
| Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees | 2 | 6 |
| South Teeside | 2 | 6 |

### Leeds and Bradford

Including both Leeds and Bradford in the sample area makes the ‘Establishment type’ more representative of the wider placement school population. However, this area is not representative of the ‘Phase of education’ or ‘Percentage of free school meals’.

Therefore, whilst this area does not improve the overall representativeness of the sample, it could be helpful if a larger sample of ‘Academies’ is required for targeted analysis.

| Characteristic | Representative across all categories | Representative across categories of interest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pupil numbers | No | Not applicable |
| Urban-rural setting | No | No |
| Percentage of free school meals | No | Not applicable |
| Establishment type | No | Yes |
| Phase of education | No | No |
| Ofsted rating | Yes | Yes |
| Religious character | Yes | Yes |

## Tyneside-based providers expanded network

6 of the providers in Tyneside also operate in Northumberland and Durham.

Both have similar characteristics, although Northumberland has a better distribution of rural-urban classification.

| Local authority | Number of providers in the area | Number of placements schools in the area |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tyneside | 7 | 183 |
| Northumberland | 6 | 74 |
| Durham | 6 | 30 |
| Sunderland | 5 | 27 |
| Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees | 5 | 15 |
| South Teeside | 4 | 14 |
| Darlington | 3 | 9 |
| Leeds | 1 | 7 |
| Lincolnshire CC | 2 | 7 |
| North Yorkshire | 3 | 6 |

### Tyneside and Northumberland

Including Tyneside and Northumberland in the sample area does not improve the representativeness of any characteristics compared to Tyneside alone. All the surrounding regions of Tyneside share similar placement school characteristics.

| Characteristic | Representative across all categories | Representative across categories of interest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pupil numbers | Yes | Not applicable |
| Urban-rural setting | No | No |
| Percentage of free school meals | No | Not applicable |
| Establishment type | No | No |
| Phase of education | No | Yes |
| Ofsted rating | Yes | Yes |
| Religious character | No | No |

## Conclusion

No adjacent region could be included in the sample for the 3 shortlisted regions to improve its overall representativeness.

Leeds is the best region when ranked on both value and representativeness. If we require a larger population of academies for detailed analysis, then Bradford would be the best region for expansion.

[Phase 4](/manage-school-placements/beta-location-analysis-phase-4/) investigates Leeds’s characteristics and highlights important considerations for performance analysis.
