We investigated the value of adding an additional region to our sample to improve the overall representativeness.

## Expanding the sample area

We considered 2 approaches for expanding the sample area:​

1. Expand into an adjacent local area​
2. Expand into a separate rural region

### Expanding into an adjacent local area​

The advantage of expanding into an adjacent local area is that it streamlines expansion by utilising onboarded provider-school networks.​

The drawback of expanding into an adjacent local area is that the surrounding areas are heavily urban so give limited improvement in rural-urban representativeness.​

### Expanding into a separate rural region​

The advantage of expanding into a separate rural region is that there is a potential to diversify and improve rural-urban classification representativeness.​

The drawback of expanding into a separate rural region is that it increases resources required to onboard a new area.

## Focus on expanding into an adjacent local area

We decided to focus on expanding to an adjacent local area.

Engaging with local ecosystems critical for a successful beta. By engaging with an adjacent local area we can expand within the same networks that are already using the service. ​

​Our strategy will be to target the networks of current provider partners (providers located in our beta sample region). This will help target our extension into areas within existing service user networks and optimises our chances of success by building on proven relationships.​

Future expansion into a rural areas will be explored if evidence suggests rural schools will interact differently with our service.

## Birmingham based providers expanded network

In general, providers in Birmingham operate across a wide area. This will be partially influenced by the way in which we have classified the location of SCITTs as some regional providers have the most placement school partners in Birmingham. ​

​Upon investigation of the potential of these areas to improve the representativeness of Birmingham, Sandwell was chosen as the most appropriate region. This is because Staffordshire placement schools had similar characteristics to Birmingham.

| Local authority | Number of providers in the area | Number of placements schools in the area |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Birmingham |  |  |
| Staffordshire CC |  |  |
| Sandwell |  |  |
| Solihul |  |  |
| Dudley |  |  |
| Warwickshire CC |  |  |
| Worcestershire CC |  |  |
| Walsall |  |  |
| Wolverhampton |  |  |

### Birmingham and Sandwell

Including both Birmingham and Sandwell in the sample area does not improve the representativeness of any characteristics compared to Birmingham alone. The large placement school population in Birmingham is likely a key factor in this result as it will require a large contrasting placement school population to meaningfully improve the representativeness. If Birmingham is chosen, multiple areas should be considered for expansion.

| Characteristic | Representative across all categories | Representative across categories of interest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pupil numbers | No | Not applicable |
| Urban-rural setting | No | No |
| Percentage of free school meals | No | Not applicable |
| Establishment type | Yes | Yes |
| Phase of education | No | Yes |
| Ofsted rating | No | No |
| Religious character | No | No |

## Leeds based providers expanded network

All the providers located in Leeds also operate in ‘Bradford’ and ‘Calderdale and Kirklees’ so these are both good options for a second region. ​

​Bradford has a large number of placement schools that are ‘Academies’ so this region has the best potential to improve the representativeness of the Leeds Placement schools. ​

| Local authority | Number of providers in the area | Number of placements schools in the area |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Leeds |  |  |
| Bradford |  |  |
| Calderdale and Kirklees |  |  |
| Wakefield |  |  |
| North Yorkshire CC |  |  |
| Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham |  |  |
| East Riding of Yorkshire |  |  |
| Sheffield |  |  |
| Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees |  |  |
| South Teeside |  |  |

### Leeds and Bradford

Including both Leeds and Bradford in the sample area makes ‘Establishment type’ more representative of the wider placement school population. However, this area is not representative on ‘Phase of education’ or ‘Percentage free school meals’. ​

Therefore, whilst this area does not improve the overall representativeness of the sample, it could be useful if a larger sample of ‘Academies’ is required for targeted analysis.

| Characteristic | Representative across all categories | Representative across categories of interest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pupil numbers | No | Not applicable |
| Urban-rural setting | No | No |
| Percentage of free school meals | No | Not applicable |
| Establishment type | No | Yes |
| Phase of education | No | No |
| Ofsted rating | Yes | Yes |
| Religious character | Yes | Yes |

## Tyneside based providers expanded network

6 of the providers located in Tyneside are also operating in Northumberland and Durham. ​

Both have similar characteristics, although Northumberland has a better distribution of rural-urban classification.

| Local authority | Number of providers in the area | Number of placements schools in the area |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tyneside |  |  |
| Northumberland |  |  |
| Durham |  |  |
| Sunderland |  |  |
| Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees |  |  |
| South Teeside |  |  |
| Darlington |  |  |
| Leeds |  |  |
| Lincolnshire CC |  |  |
| North Yorkshire |  |  |

### Tyneside and Northumberland

Including both Tyneside and Northumberland in the sample area does not improve the representativeness of any characteristics compared to Tyneside alone. All the surrounding regions to Tyneside share similar placement school characteristics.

| Characteristic | Representative across all categories | Representative across categories of interest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pupil numbers | Yes | Not applicable |
| Urban-rural setting | No | No |
| Percentage of free school meals | No | Not applicable |
| Establishment type | No | No |
| Phase of education | No | Yes |
| Ofsted rating | Yes | Yes |
| Religious character | No | No |

## Conclusion

For the 3 shortlisted regions, there is no adjacent region that could be included in the sample to improve their overall representativeness. ​

Leeds is the best region when ranked on both ‘value’ and representativeness. If a larger population of Academies is required for detailed analysis then the best region for expansion would be Bradford. ​

[Phase 4](/manage-school-placements/beta-location-analysis-phase-4/) investigates the characteristics of Leeds and highlights important considerations for performance analysis.
