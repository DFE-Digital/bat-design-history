## Who we spoke to

We spoke to 6 school users responsible for coordinating initial teacher training (ITT) within their school or trust.

The research participants included:

- 5 multi-academy trusts (MATs) and 1 community school
- a mix of primary and secondary schools
- a mix of rural and urban settings spread across different parts of England
- a mix of religious and non-religious schools

## Goals of the research

The goal of user research round 3 was to answer the following questions:

- Does the new start page help orientate users and avoid confusion when they enter the service for the first time?
- Have the iterations made to the ‘Add placement’ journey addressed the feedback from [user research round 1](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-1-findings/)?
- Have the iterations made to the ‘Add mentor’ journey addressed the feedback from [user research round 1](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-1-findings/)?
- What placement management functionality is needed by schools?
- What will help schools keep their placement and mentor information up to date?
- Does the concept of having partnerships within the service make sense to school users, are they comfortable with how these partnerships are added and managed, and what related features would be valuable to schools?

## What we tested

We tested the next iterations of the ‘Add placement’ and ‘Add mentor’ journeys following changes made after [user research round 1](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-1-findings/).

## Key insights

### Insight 1

The new start page provided some useful orientation but the content requires improvement in multiple areas. Also, as found in [user research round 1](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-1-findings/), the requirement to provide Teacher Reference Numbers (TRNs) is an anticipated pain point.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

The purpose and scope of the service needs to be clearer as "use this service to record ITT placements at your organisation” is not descriptive enough. Some participants assumed that the service allows them to create trainee requests that are sent to providers rather than the service being used to make their placement capacity visible. Some also worried that entering placement information into a DfE service might be considered a more formal commitment than schools are willing to make early in their planning cycle.

> “I think schools will be a little bit nervous around this because it’s very formal and they'd really worry about flexibility around ‘Oh, the dynamics of the department have changed. We can’t offer that anymore.’ So I think it might make them nervous about committing to offering a placement – particularly in those smaller departments. It’s easier in the big departments because, if there’s any movement of staff, you’ve probably got somebody that can stand in. But, in the smaller departments, they might be reluctant to offer a place if they think that situation might change and they’re committing to it on a portal.”

All participants were confused to different extents by the reference to mentor TRNs and dates of birth on the start page. It was unclear when and why this information is required.

> “What is the purpose of the teacher reference number? My thought process on that would be, frustratingly, some teachers not knowing it – especially if they’ve been teaching for a while... And it asks for date of birth. Why is that important? I found that very left field. Both are something I haven’t been asked before.”

### Insight 2

Participants understood and were able to follow the instruction to add a placement contact before creating their first placement and the process of adding the placement contact was straightforward. However, further design work is required to reduce or remove duplicated effort when keeping the placement contact details up to date alongside a separate list of Users.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

All participants were able to navigate to the ‘Add placement contact’ screen and the information required (contact name and email) was in line with what they expected. They understood the purpose of the placement contact although some additional guidance would be useful to avoid this having to be assumed.

Although most participants followed the “You must add the ITT placement contact email before adding a placement” instruction without considering any alternatives, one participant questioned why the placement contact details are not connected to the list of Users and commented that there would be duplicated effort. For example, if the placement contact leaves the school, someone will need to update the User tab and Organisation details tab separately.

### Insight 3

School year for primary placements and placement window are both considered to be gaps in the ‘Add placement’ journey.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

At primary schools, the capacity to host a trainee would be in a particular class or year group. So not capturing this would lead to irrelevant enquiries from ITT providers.

> "I'd be a bit worried about clicking just primary because it might suggest that I'm open to any year group. For secondary, it’s different because in my geography department, yes, I’ve got an ECT but I’ve also got some really experienced staff. But in a small primary you’ve only got one class – like a one form intake. You’ve got year 1, year 2, year 3. I don’t want one in year 1, I only want one in year 3. So by clicking primary am I then saying I’m open to anyone?"

In [user research round 1](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-1-findings/), academic terms were used to capture the placement window and flaws were identified with this approach so the screen was removed. However, this round of research confirmed that there does need to be a way to indicate what points in the year the placement capacity is available. Similarly to school year for primary placements, not capturing the placement window would lead to irrelevant enquiries from ITT providers.

> "Before we got to this page [placement details screen], did it actually say when we were offering this placement? Whether it was for, you know, placement 1 or placement 2. I feel it needs to be what we currently say to our Principles and leaders which is ‘do you have capacity available to offer a trainee for a full year or in between certain key dates?’ So normally September to Christmas is placement 1 and then, with the ITAPs and things, I think it’s now February to June for placement 2… I just feel that you need to give them that option or else you might be missing out because they haven’t got capacity to do it for the whole year but they have got capacity to do it for part of the year.”

### Insight 4

The purpose and user benefit of the partner providers feature was unclear to most participants.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

Most participants needed the purpose of the partner providers feature to be explained to them, to different extents, as the concept was not intuitive. For example:

- the majority did not see why they should need to add a provider as a partner before being able to assign a placement to that provider
- some assumed that ‘partner providers’ were DfE’s partners rather than the school’s partners
- one participant felt that DfE should know these partner relationships from other DfE services

> "For me, the government should be able to do this anyway because they’re all listed on Apply. For me, that should be a DfE copy and paste.”

### Insight 5

The effort required to get TRNs might deter schools from adding their mentors into the service.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

As also identified in [user research round 1](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-1-findings/), the user adding the mentor would need to get the mentor TRNs from their HR team or from the mentors themselves and this could involve significant effort.

Since user research round 1 was completed, [date of birth was added to the ‘Add mentor’ journey](/manage-school-placements/adding-date-of-birth-to-the-add-mentor-flow/) to improve information security. Because the mentor date of birth can be found at the same time as the TRN, adding this requirement is not a significant additional burden on top of the effort already required to get the TRN.

> "[Providing TRN and DOB] is frustrating. It’s just another layer of workload that I do not think a professional tutor or an ITT school should have to be doing. We do not do it now so why are we doing it here? What we do now is we just add the mentor name and email address and then the university provider contacts them as well as the professional tutor for any training or other communication.”

> "I do not think you need the mentors. And it came with a warning at the start that you need your mentor’s name and TRN... What are you checking that they’re an actual teacher? For me, this is just a matching up exercise. ‘We’ve got an English placement at this school. Do you want it? Yeah, we do. Right. OK, let’s have a conversation.’ The mentor will be this person and we’ll confirm in July at best. For me, that’s not adding anything to the service and I wouldn’t be shocked if all of ours just say unknown.”

### Insight 6

The repetitive nature of adding multiple placements will likely be a source of frustration for MATs and larger schools.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

As also identified in [user research round 1](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-1-findings/), some participants felt it would be better to enter their placement capacity in a single journey rather than repeating the ‘Add placement’ journey for each placement.

> "That’s a little bit time consuming. With the two university providers we have, it’s just a drop down menu for each subject. So that’s all done on one form, whereas you’re essentially saying I would have to do this 7-8 times for 7-8 different subjects... if somebody then has to do it 10, 12, 15, 20 times there’s the possibility for mistakes to happen or for people to stop getting involved in the process, which would be a real shame.”

## Hypotheses to test

### Hypothesis 1

We think that schools likely will not add partner providers until the point that they have to within the service so their list of partner providers might not include all the providers they work with.

We think this because participants have struggled to understand and use this feature in most of the research sessions. They cannot currently see a benefit in adding their partner providers into the service until the point that it’s required in order to assign a placement to that provider.

We will test this by monitoring how partnerships are used during the Private Beta and understanding schools’ experiences through more user research.

### Hypothesis 2

We think that schools might forget to update their placement contact if that person leaves the school.

We think this because remembering to update the placement contact is an additional task on top of updating the list of Users, and we know that keeping the User list up to date and handing over services when teachers leave a school can be a pain point.

We will test this by monitoring how the ‘Edit placement contact’ feature is used during the Private Beta and understanding schools’ experiences through more user research.

### Hypothesis 3

We think that the effort required to get TRNs might deter schools from adding their mentors into the service.

We think this is because getting TRNs can involve significant effort for the user and the benefit of adding mentors wasn’t always clear to participants.

We will test this by monitoring how the ‘Add mentor’ feature is used during the Private Beta and understanding schools’ experiences through more user research.

### Hypothesis 4

We think that the ability to add multiple placements as part of a single journey would be valuable to MATs and larger schools.

We think this is because participants in this round and [user research round 1](/manage-school-placements/user-research-round-1-findings/) have highlighted this need.

We will test this by designing options for how this could look and testing them in future user research rounds.
