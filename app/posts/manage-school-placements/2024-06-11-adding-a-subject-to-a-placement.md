In user research we observed that some participants confused the ‘Select all that apply’ instruction on the ‘Subject’ screen for secondary school placements. They interpreted it as saying they should select all subjects relevant to the school rather than only those applicable to the individual placement. In most cases, there will only be one subject for a single placement, but there are exceptions, such as for French and Spanish placements.

## What we changed

- We changed the subject page for secondary phase subjects to only allow a single selection.

- We made it possible for users who select ‘modern languages’ to further specify which languages the placement is for.

## How it works

### Secondary subjects list

When a placement is added at the secondary phase, the user can choose from a list of subjects. We changed the input on this page from checkboxes to radios, meaning that the user can only choose a single item.

### Modern languages page

If a user chooses modern languages from the secondary subjects list, they’re taken to a  page with a list of the modern languages taken from Publish teacher training courses. They are able to select multiple languages if they choose to.

### Placement titles

By default, placements take the title of the subject. If the placement is for modern languages, then the placement title is the language or languages selected.

## Further considerations

We tested this with school users. They found it easy to use to add placements.

We did receive feedback that there may be scenarios where it was useful to break other subjects down in the same way we have done with modern languages. The subjects that came up were design and technology, which may be broken into specialisms, and physical education, which is taught by gender.

At present we don’t have enough information to decide if these extra subject breakdowns are necessary. We will continue to test with users and monitor service usage through private beta.
