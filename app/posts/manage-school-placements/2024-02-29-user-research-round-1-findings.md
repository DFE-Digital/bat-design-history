## Who we spoke to

We spoke to 6 x school users responsible for coordinating initial teacher training (ITT) within their school or trust

Including:

- 4 x multi-academy trusts (MATs) and 2 x single academy trusts
- 2 x rural, 2 x urban and 2 x mixed rural and urban settings (within a MAT) spread across different parts of England
- Mix of primary and secondary schools
- Mix of religious and non-religious schools

## Goals of the research

The goal of user research round 1 was to answer the following questions:

- How do school users find the experience of entering the service for the first time to add their school’s placement and mentor capacity?
- What information should go into the creation of a placement and how should this work from a school perspective?
- What are schools’ expectations and needs around who will be able to see their placement and mentor information?
- How would schools like ITT providers to contact them about a placement opportunity and is there value in making contact via the service?
- How would schools update their mentor and placement information and what would help them do that?
- What is most useful for school users to see when they login to the service as a returning user?

## What we tested

We tested a first iteration of the ‘add a mentor’ and ‘add a placement’ journeys as well as getting general feedback on the overall service and its value to school users – building on the prototype produced as part of the Alpha phase.

## Key insights

### Insight 1

Most school users were positive about the potential of the service (it could help with a current pain point) but its value relies heavily on other factors such as ITT providers not requesting the same information separately and the new mentor training requirements not being the barrier they’re expected to be by some school users.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

As found during the Discovery phase, different ITT providers currently have different ways of requesting a school’s placement and mentor information – some have a digital tool or send a digital form whereas others request the information in a spreadsheet or word processing document. Schools currently need to repeat this task for each provider they work with, which is time consuming, and updating this information after it’s been submitted is also a challenge.

> This might stop the last-minute panics that we sometimes receive from people whose placements have collapsed because somebody's resigned or whatever. And the training is meant to start next week, and they've got nowhere to send them and they're frantically phoning around going "can anybody help?" Having a centralised hub might stop that so they can at least see.

However, the service’s appeal is dependent on ITT providers no longer requesting the same information separately so that the service replaces what they currently do rather than being additional. There were also concerns from some school users that other pressures on mentor availability [which were also highlighted during the Discovery phase](https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/manage-school-placements/problems-with-school-placements/) will reduce the amount of placements schools are willing to add to the service or make the information less reliable.

> My colleagues in schools who just take placements aren't even thinking about mentor training. They will just be used to getting emails and phone calls from universities and SCITTs saying can you have a placement and offering what they can offer. That's based upon very little mentor training going on and they don't know yet that you need to have 20 hours.

### Insight 2

We need to more clearly define what a ‘placement’ is within the service and look at different ways to connect mentors and placements to avoid confusion and duplication.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

It often wasn’t clear to school users that the service requires them to enter each placement individually. And some users felt it would be better if they could enter their placement capacity as part of one set of screens rather than repeating the ‘add a placement’ journey for each placement.

The ‘Select all that apply’ instruction on the ‘Subject’ screen for secondary school placements confused some users as they interpreted it as saying they should select all of the subjects relevant to the school rather than only those relevant to the individual placement being added. In most cases, there will only be one subject for a single placement but there are exceptions such as for French and Spanish placements.

### Insight 3

Having to add a mentor before being able to add a placement viewed as an unnecessary barrier.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

The prototype was set up so that users need to add at least one mentor before being able to add a placement. This was felt to be an unnecessary barrier by most users, as the choice to offer a placement often happens without a mentor being confirmed, and they said they would likely just add one mentor in order to get around this restriction rather than adding all of their mentors before adding their first placement (which was the intention behind the design),

> I often wouldn't know who the mentor is or it might change so it's a bit silly doing it now. I can understand what it's asking me to do but it's putting the cart before the horse because it can change so frequently.

### Insight 4

The service feels familiar because schools use other DfE services that look and work similarly although this does increase the potential for confusion between the different services.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

School users found it easy to navigate around the prototype service and many of them commented that it worked in a similar way to other DfE services and that this was a positive.

> That’s exactly the same as the trainee applications service. So there is a sort of continuity there if you're used to other DfE services – it's very similar.

However, a negative was that – at certain points – some users got confused about the difference between the school placements service, Publish teacher training courses service and Manage training for early career teachers service because they look similar and are all part of the broader teacher training journey.

### Insight 5

Based on the prototype that was tested, it's not an overly burdensome task for schools to provide the placement and mentor information required. However, we need to get ITT providers' perspectives as any additions to satisfy their needs might increase the effort of adding and maintaining the information for schools.

#### Supporting detail and evidence

4 of the users from this round were from Multi-Academy Trusts and, even for MATs with 10+ schools, it wasn’t viewed as a significant amount of effort to add their placements and mentors into the service as long as they didn’t still have to provide this information separately to ITT providers (i.e. this service replaces what they currently do rather than being additional).

> It's not effort, it's just you don't want to duplicate it. I'm already duplicating it for 3 providers so would this would be a 4th. So if this replaces what I'm doing for them, then great because I'm doing it once not 3 times but if it's just adding to that then it's pretty pointless from my point of you – there's no benefit to me.

## Hypotheses to test in future research

### Hypothesis 1

A start page might help orientate users before entering the service to avoid confusion around how this service is different from other teacher training related DfE services, and how ‘a placement’ is defined within the service.

### Hypothesis 2

A different design pattern for adding multiple subjects to an individual placement might help avoid confusion while adding a placement – replacing the checkboxes that are currently used. There is a need to be able to have a single placement with multiple subjects (e.g. a placement for French and Spanish) but it's a rarer scenario so can be treated as an exception.

### Hypothesis 3

One user was concerned about ITT providers contacting their mentors directly if their names were shown on placement opportunities. Our hypothesis is that ITT providers likely don’t need to know the name of the mentor and it would be sufficient for them to only see whether the mentor has or has not been assigned. We will explore this in user research round 2 with ITT providers.

### Hypothesis 4

It might provide additional reassurance if there was guidance text explaining to users that they can edit a placement after it has been published and if there was the ability to preview what the placement looks like to ITT providers. All the users we spoke to in this round were comfortable with their placements being visible to all providers using the service but this additional reassurance could be helpful for those that have any reservations – such as whether the assigned mentor’s name will or won’t be shown.
