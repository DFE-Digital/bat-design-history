## Context

When we designed improvements to [how course content is structured](/find-teacher-training/structuring-course-content-design-with-candidates/) on Find, and tested the new course content in [user research with candidates](/find-teacher-training/structuring-couse-content-user-research-with-candidates/), we found that the new course structure tested well, however information providers give about courses was too generic.

We needed to help support providers to give more in-depth information that covers the different aspects of training experience that will be provided.

## What we changed

### Removed 'About this course'

We removed the section 'About this course', as it was too broad and not helping providers to consistently cover the topics that candidates needed.

### More focussed questions with shorter word limits

Previously we had a single large text input with guidance to cover a whole topic:

The new design converts the guidance into separate questions to help focus:

This also allowed us to reduce the word count for each of the new questions.

###Â What you wrote last cycle

Because of the new structure, we would not be able to populate the text inputs with what the providers wrote last cycle, like we have done in previous years.

We added a [details](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/details/) component to display the information from last cycle, so that providers can use it as a reference, and copy and paste the information if needed.

### Live preview

To help providers check the information has been added correctly, we designed a live preview that sits at the bottom of each section.

We hypothesis that this will reduce the number of markdown errors on course pages.

## Next steps

These designs were tested with providers.

The findings are written in the following post: [User research with providers on redesigns to course content](/publish-teacher-training-courses/user-research-with-provider-on-redesigns-to-course-content/).
