We wanted to make sure that providers felt supported when using and onboarding to Publish teacher training courses (Publish). Following the initial teacher training (ITT) reforms, providers needed to know how to:

-	add newly accredited organisations to the service
-	add and remove users from existing organisations
-	partner with a different accredited provider
-	roll over courses from one recruitment cycle to the next

## What we changed

We included a short description of the Publish service to the ‘How to use this service’ page and added links to the guidance pages under new headings.

### How to use this service

## Future considerations

There may be a need to add more guidance pages in the future, for example, how to publish and schedule courses. We will continue to monitor this in our user research sessions with providers.

If we make any iterations to the service, we will need to update the guidance pages to match. We may also find ways to link to the pages from the in-service guidance.

We will monitor the performance of the pages using Google Analytics to help us determine their effectiveness.
