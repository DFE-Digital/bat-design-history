Whilst reviewing the Support Console on Publish, it became apparent that the admin users had not been reviewed and updated.

Admin users are colleagues working at the Department for Education (DfE) who can access the Support console and undertake a variety of tasks such as:

- review and update provider details
- duplicate the view from a provider, allowing them to undertake any of the actions as provider user can do, such as adding, withdrawing and deleting courses

We therefore set about creating a policy and process to ensure that only colleagues who required access to the Support Console, were still active on the service.

## What we did

We liaised with the Apply team, who shared their policy and process. After reviewing these documents we created a separate policy and process for Publish.

## Why we did this

It is critical for data protection and security that only authorised and appropriate users have access to the Support Console.

Currently, there is only data relating to providers, their courses and users. However, from September, personal information about candidates who create accounts on Find will be introduced to Publish. Therefore, it is critical that this policy was introduced prior to the introduction of these accounts.

## Policy

All colleagues who require access to Publish will continue to keep their accounts. The main users are from the following teams:

- Find/Publish team
- Apply/Manage team
- Operations and Support team
- Data and insights team
- Deputy Service Owners
- Schools Digital senior leadership colleagues

We will delete any user who:

- Does not work in any of the above teams or roles
- No longer works at DfE
- Has access with their @digital.education.gov.uk account, as these are legacy accounts which have been retired

## Process for implementation

We liaised with the Operations and Support Team to request a list of users who should remain.

We then removed any user who met the above three scenarios for removal.

This resulted in 79 admin users being removed on 31 July 2025.

To ensure that this process is reviewed regularly we have scheduled a monthly slot to remove appropriate admin users.

## Further considerations

We would like to further align with the Apply team's process, by introducing some automation of user removal, such as removing users who havenâ€™t logged on to the service for over 9 months.

However, this would require developer support, which is not feasible at the moment.

## Next steps

We will continue to review admin users every month and will look to assess whether any automation can be introduced in the next recruitment cycle.
