We recently made several changes to Publish teacher training courses (Publish) to improve site navigation and manage provider relationships.

As part of these changes, we reviewed how organisation details were organised and made some improvements.

## What we changed

Previously we simplified how lead schools manage their accredited body relationships. This included:

- removing adding the accredited body’s description in ‘Organisation details’
- adding a section called ‘Accredited bodies’, accessible via the primary navigation

In this piece of work have separated the content into 4 sections:

- organisation details - including the provider name, provider code, UK provider reference number (UKPRN) and unique reference number (URN)
- about your organisation
- visa sponsorship - if the provider is an accredited body
- contact details - including email address, telephone number and address

The organisation details, visa sponsorship and contact details sections span two-thirds of the page’s width.

The ‘Train with your organisation’ section spans full width as it contains long-form content, and we wanted to make it easier to read without too much scrolling.

## How it works

### Organisation details

Selecting a change link next to UKPRN or URN takes the user to a page where they can edit either reference number.

We give links to the [UK register of learning providers](https://www.ukrlp.co.uk/) and [Get information about schools](https://www.get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) to help the user find the relevant reference number if not known.

We show ‘Not entered’ on the summary list if the user does not enter a reference number.

### About your organisation

Selecting the change link to ‘Training with your organisation’ or ‘Training with disabilities and other needs’ takes the user to a page where they can edit each answer.

Each question is on a separate page, and the content is specific to the question.

We display help text in a details component below the form fields.

We show ‘Not entered’ on the summary list if the user does not enter details for ‘Training with your organisation’ or ‘Training with disabilities and other needs’.

Any changes to these fields are immediately updated on published courses.

### Visa sponsorship

Changes to the visa sponsorship section are discussed in the post [adding questions about visa sponsorship to courses](/publish-teacher-training-courses/adding-questions-about-visa-sponsorship-to-courses/#organisation-settings-page).

### Contact details

Selecting a change link next to any contact details takes the user to a page where they can edit all the contact details.

We show an error message if the user does not enter:

- email address
- telephone number
- website
- address line 1
- town or city
- postcode

Any changes to these fields are immediately updated on published courses.
