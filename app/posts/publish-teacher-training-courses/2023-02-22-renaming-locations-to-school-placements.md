We replaced the term ‘Locations’ with ‘School placements’ to reflect the information displayed on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

## What we changed

We have changed the:

- locations page in the ‘Add course’ flow
- summary list on the ‘Check your answers’ page of the ‘Add course’ flow
- summary list on the course basic details page
- locations page in the ‘Edit location’ flow
- success and error messages

### Summary lists

If there is only one school placement, we use the singular ‘School placement’ for the label. If there is more than one school placement, we use the plural ‘School placements’.
