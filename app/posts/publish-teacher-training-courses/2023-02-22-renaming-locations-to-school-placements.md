We replaced the term ‘Locations’ with ‘School placements’ to reflect how the information is displayed on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

## What we changed

We have changed the:

- locations page in the ‘Add course’ flow
- summary list on the ‘Check your answers’ page of the ‘Add course flow
- summary list on the course basic details page
- locations page in the ‘Edit location’ flow
- success and error messages
