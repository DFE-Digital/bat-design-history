A much simplified training location flow. It replicates what is available on UCAS, without any extras.

This design represents a baseline we could build first. We’d then iterate towards the training location wizards, adding a [school autocomplete](/publish-teacher-training-courses/schools-autocomplete), [then different types of location](/publish-teacher-training-courses/new-training-location) along with [regions or areas](/publish-teacher-training-courses/new-training-location-region).

We’d also avoid having to categorise existing locations into types, though doing this at rollover might be the only appropriate time.
