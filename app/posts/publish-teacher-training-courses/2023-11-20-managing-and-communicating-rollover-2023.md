On 3 October 2023, the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle for initial teacher training started. The start of the cycle meant that people wanting to train to teach in the 2024 to 2025 academic year could begin applying to courses on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

We followed a similar process to how we [communicated rollover in 2022](/publish-teacher-training-courses/managing-and-communicating-rollover-in-2022).

## Duplicating course information from one cycle to the next  

On 13 July 2023, we rolled over all courses published in the current recruitment cycle to the new 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle.

We copied all details and put the courses into the ‘Rolled over’ state. Providers could then review and edit the details and publish them in time for the new recruitment cycle.

## Contacting providers about rollover  

### Before rollover  

In June, we contacted providers to let them know that they will soon need to prepare and publish their courses for the new cycle.

Dear ((first_name))

On 3 October 2023, courses for the 2024 to 2025 academic year will be published on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).  

We’ll soon be making some changes in Publish teacher training courses (Publish) to allow you to edit and publish courses for the new recruitment cycle.

We’re also making some improvements to the course information we collect so that candidates can make more informed choices.

# Rolled over courses

All courses in this recruitment cycle will be rolled over to the new cycle ready to be updated and published.

In July, you’ll see a new page titled ‘Recruitment cycles' with a link, '2023 to 2024’. You can then:

* add new courses
* update rolled over courses
* delete any courses you’ll no longer be running

We’ll email you again in July to let you know when courses have been rolled over.  
 
Find out more about how rollover works: https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/how-to-use-this-service/roll-over-courses-to-a-new-recruitment-cycle  

# Improved course information

We speak to candidates regularly to understand what they need to know about initial teacher training (ITT) courses before they apply. Based on feedback from candidates, we’ve made some improvements to the way we collect course information.

## School placements

Understanding where training will take place is one of the most important factors for candidates when choosing a course.  

We know that over 80% of all course searches are by location and the only way a course can be found easily is when school placement information has been added.  

You can add school placement information by:

* adding placements quickly and easily in Publish using Get information about schools (GIAS) data – details will be automatically pre-populated for you 
* emailing us at becomingateacher@digital.gov.uk and we can add the information for you

You’ll no longer need to specify if a school placement has vacancies or not, making it easier to manage your courses.

## Study sites

We found that many candidates are not clear about where they will be doing the theoretical part of their training.  

To be able to publish a course for the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle, you’ll need to add at least one study site to the course. This could be a campus, school or other study site. You’ll be prompted to do this before you can publish a course.

## Fee for international students

We’ve learned from our research that international candidates need to know how much teacher training will cost and this information is sometimes missing from course details.
 
If your organisation does not sponsor a visa, it’s still important to add fee details. Some candidates can get visa sponsorship in other ways, such as a family or graduate visa.

Find out more about recruiting trainee teachers from overseas: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recruit-trainee-teachers-from-overseas-accredited-itt-providers

If your course does have Student visa sponsorship available, you’ll need to add the fee for international students before you’ll be able to publish the course for the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle.  

## Salaried courses

From the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle, all providers will be able to offer salaried courses. You’ll be prompted to choose if a course has a fee or a salary when creating or publishing a course.

# Next steps

We’ll contact you again in July to let you know when courses have been rolled over. In the meantime, you could start preparing your course information and descriptions ready to be added or updated.

You could also read through our guidance on how to use the Publish service: https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/how-to-use-this-service

### During rollover  

In July, we sent an email to tell providers to get their courses ready to be published.

{{ appEmail({

Dear ((first_name))

On 3 October 2023, courses for the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle will be published on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

All courses that were published this recruitment cycle have now been rolled over to the new cycle (including withdrawn ones) ready to be edited and published.

[Sign in to Publish teacher training courses (Publish)](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/sign-in) and on the ‘Recruitment cycles’ page, select ‘2023 to 2024'.

You can then:

* add new courses
* check and edit rolled over courses
* delete any courses you’ll no longer be running

# Updating courses

 Before adding and publishing rolled over courses, make sure that all school placements and study sites have been added to your account, ready to be attached to a course.  

[Find out more about adding schools and study sites to a course](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/how-to-use-this-service/add-schools-and-study-sites).

Also, check that:

* essential information, such as fees and visa sponsorship, is up to date 
* your course descriptions are specific and give candidates a good overview of what to expect  

# Publishing courses

We’ve improved the way you can preview a course page and made it easier to update the information. Use the ‘Preview course’ link on the course page to see how the course will look to candidates on Find before publishing it.

When you’re happy with your courses, you can publish them. This will schedule them to be displayed on Find as soon as it opens in October. You can still make changes to your courses after publishing them, but it’s a good idea to get them scheduled as soon as possible.

# Adding other people to your account

If your organisation has changed its relationship with an accredited provider or training partner, you can add or remove users from the account. You can also add any new colleagues who might need to be involved in managing or publishing courses.

[Find out more about adding and removing users](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/how-to-use-this-service/add-and-remove-users).

Some providers had issues with publishing courses because many had to form new relationships with accredited providers. This was due to the ITT Reform carried out by the Department for Education. In August, [we sent further emails to all providers to help them publish their courses](/publish-teacher-training-courses/emailing-providers-to-let-them-know-study-sites-is-no-longer-mandatory).

In early September we sent another email to providers remind them to publish their courses.

Dear ((first_name))

On 3 October 2023, courses for the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle will be published on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

Before 3 October, check and publish your ‘rolled over’ courses, if you haven’t already.

If you cannot publish your rolled over courses, email [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk?subject=Cannot%20publish%20rolled%20over%20courses)

# Check and publish your courses

[Sign in to Publish teacher training courses (Publish)](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/sign-in) and on the ‘Recruitment cycles’ page, select ‘2023 to 2024’.

You can then:

* add new courses
* check and edit rolled over courses
* delete any courses you’ll no longer be running

Before publishing courses, make sure that the information you’ve provided is up to date.

Having complete and accurate information gives candidates the best possible experience when looking for a suitable course.

Check that:

* ‘Study site’ information is correct if you’ve added this – you do not need to add a study site to publish a course
* ‘Schools’ information is correct – you only need to add at least one school placement to publish a course
* all essential information, such as fees and visa sponsorship, is up to date
* your course descriptions are specific and give candidates a good overview of what to expect

When your courses are ready, you can schedule them to go live as soon as Find opens on 3 October (you can still make changes to them after doing this).

### After rollover  

On 27 October, we sent a more targeted reminder to providers who had courses that had not been published or withdrawn.

{{ appEmail({

subject: "Publish your rolled over courses for the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle",

content: "

Hello ((first_name)) 

We’ve noticed that your organisation has some unpublished courses in the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle. 

# What you can do now 

You can publish or withdraw rolled over courses by signing in to [Publish teacher training courses (Publish)](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/sign-in).

If you do not want to publish a course for the current recruitment cycle but might want to publish it next cycle, you can withdraw the course. This means you’ll be able to keep the course in your account and it will be rolled over next year.

If you have any rolled over courses in draft and you no longer want to publish them, you can delete them.

## Additional communications
