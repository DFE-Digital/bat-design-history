When a provider publishes a course, they can list all the locations where a candidate can gain experience. These locations are shown in the ‘School placements’ section of Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

In addition to the list of locations, we also show vacancies for each location. This allows providers to show where a candidate can train. The vacancy status on Find is a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’.

In Publish teacher training courses (Publish), users can update the vacancy status of each location in the list. They can either mark all schools as not having vacancies or individually select locations with vacancies.

If all locations do not have vacancies, the course is marked as ‘Closed’ in Publish. The course is still available on Find, but candidates cannot apply.

## What we changed

We have:

- moved the vacancies section into a tab on the course details
- updated the vacancies flow

## How it works


## Further considerations

We considered moving vacancies to the course level. Providers don’t often know the number of vacancies per location or the locations available to accept placements when the course is opened.

We didn’t make this change because we need to learn more about how this information could be used to improve the candidate’s decision-making.
