The Publish teacher training courses (Publish) team wanted to standardise course names and introduce a new policy to inform this.

When creating new courses in Publish, providers can only choose structured options, and do not have the ability to create bespoke courses.

As such, when they want to create a course with a unique name, they email the Support team to request this.

Previously, this team would refer to the [original guidance produced in 2022](/publish-teacher-training-courses/guidance-on-how-training-providers-should-name-their-courses/) in order to determine whether the bespoke course could be actioned.

However, feedback from the team suggested that this original policy needed to be updated.

## Aim

The aim of updating this new policy was to clarify to Support colleagues what they should and should not permit providers to name courses when responding to support tickets regarding modifying course names.

This is the policy for all course names for Becoming a Teacher (BaT) services; including Find, Publish, Apply, Manage.

This policy only applies to names for courses which lead to qualified teacher status (QTS).

## Context

To design the course naming policy, we undertook several steps including:

- reviewing the [initial design history on course naming](/publish-teacher-training-courses/guidance-on-how-training-providers-should-name-their-courses/)
- identifying existing issues with course name standardisation
- liaising with the Support team and reviewing key themes from support tickets.

By doing this, we discovered that the main issues were regarding the formatting and naming of subjects, as well as the inclusion of inappropriate content in course names.

## The Policy

Therefore we updated the policy to outline multiple rules for Support colleagues to adhere to when creating bespoke course names including:

- do not include the accredited provider’s name in the course title
- do not include the school or location name in the course title
- do not use the organisation type in the course title - for example, school centred initial teacher training provider (SCITT) or higher education institution (HEI)
- do not use the ITT route in the course title - for example, ‘school direct’
- do not include the education phase or age range in the course title - for example, ‘Secondary’, ‘Early years’, ‘3-7’, or key stage
To note: Primary is both a subject and a phase so is an exception to this rule.

- do not include study mode in the course title - for example, ‘full time’ or ‘part time’, ‘online’, ‘hybrid’
- do not include the funding type in the course title - for example, ‘salaried’, ‘fee paying’ or ‘tuition’
- do not include financial incentives in the course title - for example, ‘bursary’, ‘scholarship’ or the monetary value of the incentive
- do not include the qualification in the course title - for example, post graduate certificate of education (PGCE)
- do not include the status gained in the course title - for example, ‘QTS’
- only allow subject groupings of ‘modern languages’ ‘design and technology’ and ‘social sciences’ and do not permit ‘humanities’
To note: Science is a subject, however, ‘science’ must not be used as a general title for combinations of biology, chemistry and physics.

- only allow pre-approved subject specialisms in course titles (listed below in the next section)
- do not use special characters (for example, ampersands, asterisks and hyphens) or full capitalised words (apart from SEND) in the course title.
- do not use generic terms in the course title - for example, ‘teacher training’, ‘education’, ‘general’ or ‘school’.
- course names must be written in sentence case, with any languages (e.g. English, French, Japanese) being the only exceptions.

## Specialisms

Specialisms other than those provided in the course creation pages of Publish should not be included in course titles.

They should instead be outlined in the ‘course details’ section of Publish.

They must be written in the way they appear in this policy. Variations of names e.g. ‘food science’ instead of ‘food technology’, or ‘SEN’ and ‘Special Educational Needs and Disabilities’ instead of ‘SEND’ are not permitted.

The key rules for specialisms are:

- specialisms which aren’t available for providers to select on Publish should be added manually by Support
- a maximum of three specialisms of the same subject can be included in each course title
- if there are two subjects e.g. mathematics and design and technology, then only one specialism per subject is permitted to be listed in the course title
- specialisms should be written in the following format: ‘(X, X, X’)
- all specialisms should be written within closed round brackets e.g. (X)
- if one of the specialisms (e.g. a language) is eligible for a bursary or scholarship it should be written first
- ‘or’ and ‘additional subjects’ must not be used to show a selection of specialisms. Separate courses should be created, or details of options included in the course description

## Permitted specialisms

The below are permitted general specialisms

- special educational needs and disabilities (SEND)

The next sections detail subject specific specialism.

### With design and technology only

- Food technology
- Product design
- Electronics
- Engineering
- Textiles

### With modern languages only

- French
- Italian
- German
- Japanese
- Mandarin
- Russian
- Spanish

This list is not exhaustive. Any other modern language is permitted to be added manually as a specialism.

Providers can do this by choosing creating a course titled ‘modern language (other)’ and submitting a request to support to change ‘other’ for their chosen language.

## Programmes

Engineers teach physics is currently the only programme which can be specified in Publish.

## Funding and subject order

Candidates may be able to get a bursary or scholarship for some subjects.If the course content is made up of at least 50% of a subject that is eligible for a bursary, this should be added as the first subject so that the correct financial information can be shown to candidates.

## Next steps

This policy will be fully implemented from May 2025 by:

- communicating the policy to all providers, as part of the planned rollover comms
- encouraging the Support team to continue to use the policy in the first instance
- continuing to liaise regularly with the Support team to ensure that the policy continues to be fit for purpose

This policy was introduced in April 2025 for all new courses from that point onwards.

Existing courses which do not adhere to this policy will be addressed during the rollover period, before the next cycle (2025/26).

This means that from the start of the 2025/26 cycle all courses will be adhering to this policy.
