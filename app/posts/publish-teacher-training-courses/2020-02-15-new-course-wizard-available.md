Development of the new course wizard began in September 2019 and was made available to accredited bodies in mid-February 2020.

## Access for accredited bodies

Accredited bodies are able to access the new course wizard from the [Courses page](https://www.qa.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/organisations/T92/2020/courses).

## Why the wizard is not yet available to school directs

School directs will not receive access to the new course wizard until Publish teacher training courses (Publish) can automatically notify their accredited body that a course has been created.

An accredited body needs to be notified immediately so they can maintain accurate data in their record systems. This was highlighted in [Accredited bodies research - Reporting round 2](/publish-teacher-training-courses/accredited-bodies-research-round-2).

Publish will shortly [provide these notifications](https://bat-design-history.netlify.com/publish-teacher-training-courses/notifications-mvp) to ensure this need is met. Once notifications are enabled all users will have access to the wizard.

## Course creation for school directs

All school direct users are required to [submit a google form](/publish-teacher-training-courses/new-course-google-form) to request a new course.

After receiving the request, DfE support creates the course manually and notifies both the school direct and associated accredited body via email of the new courseâ€™s availability.

## How to access the new course wizard via URL

Access the course wizard by appending `/new` to an organisations course page URL in Publish.
