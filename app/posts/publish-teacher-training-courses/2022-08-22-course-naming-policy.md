This is the policy for what initial teacher training (ITT) providers should include in their ITT course titles on the Becoming a teacher (BAT) services.

## Background

Previously, ITT providers could create varied names for themselves and their courses on the BAT services, with a couple of exceptions. For example, our current naming policy does not encourage providers to use school locations in their course titles, which confuses candidates.

In 2021, the market reform team introduced Teaching School Hubs and communicated to all providers that they would not be able to include ‘teaching school’ in the title of their organisation from the new cycle in October 2021. This change was explained to ITT providers using targeted communications.

Standardising course naming enables better course filtering for candidates and reduces confusion. For example, allowing ITT providers to include specific locations in their course titles means that candidates may apply all of their choices to one ITT provider, which essentially ‘wastes’ their choices as they must still get placements at two different schools during their training course.

This policy impacts the Publish teacher training courses (Publish), Apply for teacher training (Apply), and Register trainee teachers (Register) services, which need the same data from the source in Publish. This will impact whether courses have associated financial incentives and will be used for reporting by downstream analysts.

The naming policy will impact ITT providers by outlining what they are and are not allowed to name their courses on our services. In turn, this will impact how candidates browse for their courses.

## The policy

Our policy for course naming is that ITT providers should not include the following in their course titles:

- Do not include the accredited provider’s name in the course title.

- Do not include the school or location name in the course title.

- Do not use the organisation type in the course title - for example, ‘SCITT’ or ‘HEI’.

- Do not use the ITT route in the course title - for example, ‘school direct’.

- Do not include the education phase in the course title - for example, ‘Secondary’, ‘Early years’ or key stage.

- Do not include study mode in the course title - for example, ‘full time’ or ‘part time’.

- Do not include the funding type in the course title - for example, ‘salaried’, ‘fee paying’ or ‘tuition’.

- Do not include financial incentives in the course title - for example, ‘bursary’, ‘scholarship’ or the monetary value.

- Do not include the qualification in the course title - for example, ‘PGCE’, ‘PGDE’ or ‘postgraduate’.

- Do not include the status gained in the course title - for example, ‘QTS’.

- Do not include subject groupings in the course title - for example, ‘MFL’, ‘modern foreign’, or ‘humanities’.

- Do not include subject specialisms in the course title - for example ‘food technology’, ‘product design’ or ‘textiles’.

- Do not use special characters (for example, ampersands, asterisks and hyphens) or all upper case letters in the course title.

- Do not use generic terms in the course title - for example, ‘teacher training’, ‘education’, ‘general’ or ‘school’.

ITT providers should instead use the course details sections to describe the course in greater detail.

Specialisms other than those provided in the course creation pages of Publish should not be included in course titles. They should, again, be outlined in the ‘Course details’ section of Publish.

## Example course names

Course names are automatically generated by Publish and can only be changed by Support if they meet the criteria outlined above.

### Example primary course names

|Subjects|Special educational needs and disabilities (SEND)|Course name|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Primary|No|Primary|
|Primary|Yes|Primary (SEND)|
|Primary with English|No|Primary with English|
|Primary with English|Yes|Primary with English (SEND)|
|Primary with geography and history|No|Primary with geography and history|
|Primary with geography and history|Yes|Primary with geography and history (SEND)|
|Primary with mathematics|No|Primary with mathematics|
|Primary with modern languages|No|Primary with modern languages|
|Primary with physical education|No|Primary with physical education|
|Primary with science|No|Primary with science|

Age ranges such as Primary (3 to 7) can be included in course names for the next recruitment cycle (ITT 2023).
