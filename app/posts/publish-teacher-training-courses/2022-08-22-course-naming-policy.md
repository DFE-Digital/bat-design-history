This is the policy for what initial teacher training (ITT) providers should include in their ITT course titles on the Becoming a teacher (BAT) services.

## Context

Previously ITT providers have been able to create varied names for themselves and their courses on the BAT services with a couple of exceptions. For example, our current naming policy does not encourage providers to use school locations in their course titles as this confuses candidates.

In 2021, the market reform team introduced Teaching School Hubs and communicated to all providers that they would not be able to include ‘teaching school’ in the title of their organisation from the new cycle in October 2021. This change was explained to ITT providers using targeted communications.

Standardising course naming enables better course filtering for candidates and reduces confusion. For example, allowing ITT providers to include specific locations in their course titles means that candidates may apply all of their choices to one ITT provider, which essentially ‘wastes’ their choices as they must still get placements at two different schools during their training course.

This policy impacts the Publish teacher training courses (Publish), Apply for teacher training (Apply), and Register trainee teachers (Register) services, which need the same data from the source in Publish. This will impact whether courses have associated financial incentives and will be used for reporting by downstream analysts.

The naming policy will impact ITT providers by outlining what they are and are not allowed to name their courses on our services. In turn, this will impact how candidates browse for their courses.

## The policy in place

Our policy for course naming is that ITT providers should not include the following in their course titles:

- Do not include the accredited provider’s name in the course title.

- Do not include the school or location name in the course title.

- Do not use the organisation type in the course title - for example, ‘SCITT’ or ‘school direct’.

- Do not include the education phase in the course title - for example, ‘Secondary’, ‘Early years’ or key stage.

- Do not include study mode in the course title - for example, ‘full time’ or ‘part time’.

- Do not include the funding type in the course title - for example, ‘salaried’, ‘fee paying’ or ‘tuition’.

- Do not include financial incentives in the course title - for example, ‘bursary’, ‘scholarship’ or the monetary value.

- Do not include the qualification in the course title - for example, ‘QTS’, ‘PGCE’, ‘PGDE’ or ‘postgraduate’.

- Do not include subject groupings in the course title - for example, ‘MFL’, ‘modern foreign’, or ‘humanities’.

- Do not include subject specialisms - for example ‘food technology’, ‘product design’ or ‘textiles’.

- Do not use special characters (for example, asterisks and ampersands) or all upper case letters.

- Do not use generic terms - for example, ‘teacher training’, ‘education’, ‘general’ or ‘school’.

ITT providers should instead use the course details sections to describe the course in greater detail.

Specialisms other than those provided in the course creation pages of Publish should not be included in course titles. They should, again, be outlined in the ‘Course details’ section of Publish (see below for the list of specialisms currently allowed in Publish).

Age ranges such as Primary (3-7) can be included in course titles for the next recruitment cycle (ITT 2023).
