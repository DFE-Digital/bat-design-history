This research explored providers’ views on flexible Initial Teacher Training (ITT), including their understanding of related terminology and feedback on improving the Publish service.

We aimed to test the assumption that clearer guidance and standardised digital features are needed to help providers better communicate flexible training options to applicants.

This round of user research focused on validating that assumption and informing future design improvements. A follow-up phase involving candidate feedback was also planned.

## Tested changes to Publish

We tested new designs for the Publish service with providers, focusing on updated questions that highlight flexible teacher training options.

## Research objectives

Together as a team, we came up with four research objectives:

Evaluate how clearly providers communicate flexible ITT options on the Find service, including the language used in course descriptions

Identify the range of flexible ITT models currently offered and any additional adaptations providers would like to introduce

Explore challenges and barriers providers face in offering and communicating flexible ITT

Assess provider feedback on proposed design changes to the Publish service

## Participants - who we spoke to

We spoke to 6 provider participants in total.

Their roles were as follows:

| Participant number | Job role |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Recruitment co-ordinator |
| 2 | Recruitment co-ordinator |
| 3 | Director of SCITT |
| 4 | ITT co-ordinator |
| 5 | ITT Director |
| 6 | Recruitment co-ordinator|

## Methodology

Usability testing research interview conducted via Teams.

We tested new designs on the Publish service via a prototype.

## Summary of insights

We found out the following insights.

### Terminology inconsistency

Providers use a range of terms to describe flexible ITT  Initial Teacher Training (ITT), but there is significant variation and inconsistency across the sector. This can lead to confusion for both candidates and providers themselves.

### Complex challenges

Offering flexible ITT involves operational, regulatory, technical, and engagement-related barriers, requiring clearer communication and systemic support. The pain points are complex and multi-layered. ​

### Current adaptations

Current flexible teacher training adaptations focus on structured part-time routes, blended learning, placement and schedule flexibility, and individualized support for disabilities and life circumstances. However, these are balanced by significant regulatory, institutional, and practical constraints, and flexibility is typically negotiated on a case-by-case basis rather than offered as a universal entitlement.​

### Desire for expansion

Providers want to offer more flexible options (e.g., remote, bespoke, part-time), but face constraints such as institutional rigidity, regulatory limits, school partner resistance, safeguarding concerns, and financial pressures.

### Feedback on design changes

Providers support improvements to the Publish service that help communicate flexibility, but emphasize the need for clear terminology, conditional responses, and realistic candidate expectations.

## Recommendations for future candidate research

We identified the following recommendations for future research with candidates:

### Investigate how flexible ITT is experienced by candidates​

​Providers identified a gap in understanding how candidates perceive and use flexible options, especially on digital platforms like Find and Publish.​

### Identify barriers experienced by candidates ​

​Map candidate-reported barriers to accessing flexible ITT: Providers highlighted systemic, financial, and institutional constraints. ​

Explore how candidates interpret provider communications: Providers worry about over-promising or misrepresenting flexibility​

### Evaluate candidate understanding of flexible training terminology​

​Providers noted confusion around terms like "compressed hours," "flexitime," and "reduced intensity." Research should test candidate interpretations of these terms and identify which language is most accessible and meaningful.

## Recommendations for future provider research

In upcoming rounds of user research with providers, test the usefulness of a free-text box that allows them to describe the flexible provisions they offer.
