The way we refer to candidates was inconsistent to Apply for teacher training and Manage teacher training.

At the moment we use ‘applicants’ instead of ‘candidates’. We have updated the service to only refer to ‘candidates’.

We know that providers often use multiple services so we want to make sure we’re being consistent in our use of terminology.
