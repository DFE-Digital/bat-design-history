title: Changing 'applicants' to 'candidates'
description: We changed ‘applicants’ to ‘candidates’ to match the wording on Manage and Apply

We were inconsistent with the way we referred to candidates in Publish. We used a mixture of ‘applicants’ and ‘candidates’.

Manage and Apply use ‘candidates’ so we changed the content on Publish to improve consistency across the service line.

## What we changed

We have changed ‘applicants’ to ‘candidates’ on the following pages:

- About your organisation
- Course information

### About your organisation

### Course information

## Future considerations

This content change is part of a wider project to align the way we refer to things in BAT.

We know that providers often use multiple services so we want to make sure we’re being consistent in our use of terminology.

Next, we will review how we refer to cycles. See the work done by the Manage team: [Referring to recruitment cycles](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/referring-to-recruitment-cycles/).
