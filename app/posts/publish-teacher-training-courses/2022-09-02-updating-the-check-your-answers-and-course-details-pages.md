We recently changed the titles of several pages in the ‘Add course’ and edit course flows. These changes impacted the check your answers and course details summary lists.

## What we changed

We have:

- changed the ‘Check your answers’ page to make it consistent with the content in the ‘Add course’ and edit course flows
- removed some of the rows from the summary list as they were redundant
- removed the ‘Preview’ section from the ‘Check your answers’ page as it was not an accurate preview of the course on Find
- updated the course details page to make the content consistent with the changes we’ve made to the titles in the ‘Add course’ and edit course flows

### Check your answers

We changed the title of the ‘Check your answers before confirming’ page to ‘Check your answers’.

We added the caption ‘Add course’ for consistency as this page is part of the ‘Add course’ flow.

The ‘Title’ and ‘Description’ rows in the summary list were removed as they are not needed. ‘Title’ is the same as ‘Subject’ and ‘Description’ is the ‘Qualification’ plus the ‘Full time or part time’ information.

The ‘Preview’ section below the table was removed as it is not an accurate preview of what the course will look like on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find). Users can preview the course from the course details page.

We updated the button to ‘Add course’ and removed the line of text, ‘Saving this course will not publish it.’ below the button as this content was not needed.

We added a ‘Cancel’ link below the submit button.

#### Summary list headings

We changed the summary list headings to match the updated page titles in the ‘Add course’ and edit course flows. We updated:

- Subject level
- Subject - if one subject, otherwise we show plural 'Subjects'
- Qualification
- Funding type - if the organisation is a lead school, otherwise we show ‘Teaching apprenticeship’ for accredited bodies
- Full time or part time
- Location - if one location, otherwise we show plural 'Locations'
- Applications open date
- Course start date

We [show the academic year on the course details page](/publish-teacher-training-courses/showing-academic-year-on-the-course-details-page/) as hint text below the course start date.
