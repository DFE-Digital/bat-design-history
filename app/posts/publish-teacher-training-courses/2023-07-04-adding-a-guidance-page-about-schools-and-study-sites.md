From the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle, we have introduced ‘Study sites’. A study site is a place where trainees will do the theoretical part of their initial teacher training (ITT) course.

To be able to publish a course, the provider will need to attach at least one study site to it. As this is a new concept, we wanted to add a guidance page to help providers understand what they need to do. We explain why it's important that candidates can see this information on a course page on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

## What we changed

We added a new page to the ‘How to use this service’ section in Publish called ‘[Add schools and study sites](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/how-to-use-this-service/add-schools-and-study-sites)’. The page also explains how to add schools to an account and how to select them to be shown in the ‘School placements’ section on a course page.

## Further considerations

We are working on how we display school placements and study sites on a course page. Once we’ve produced a solution, we may consider updating this advice page with images to show how the content is displayed to candidates.
