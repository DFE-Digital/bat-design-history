A number of changes to the prototype had been made over the past year following best practise and research recommendations, which had not made it on to the live service.

As part of the Rollover 2024 push, we relooked at these changes - alongside more recent research findings to see if they were still suitable for Providers needs.

These changes are listed below, with the additional work we implemented.

## What we changed

1. Shortening Pages
2. Adding in Markdown Guidance
3. Removing Personal Qualities and Other Requirements
4. Changes to Course Details
5. SEND checkbox to radio buttons
6. Full Time or Part Time radio buttons to checkboxes
7. Add a Second Language validation

### 1. Shortening Pages

The Course Information page comprised of three sections - About the Course, Interview Process, and How Placements Work. Previous work had been done on the prototype to break this down into three seperate pages instead - following GDS guidance of one item per page.

We relooked at this, and updated the copy and page titles following more recent research feedback.

Additionaly, we moved the Markdown Guidance from the right-hand column to be in-situ above the text area so it's easier to refer too

The Course Length & Fees page comprised of four sections - Course Length, Course Fees, and Fees, and Financial Support. Previous work had been done on the prototype to break this down into four seperate pages instead - following GDS guidance of one item per page.

We relooked at this, and updated the copy and page titles following more recent research feedback.

We also merged the two fields/pages Fee Details and Financial Support because data showed that providers tended to enter all financial information into fee details

### 2. Adding in Markdown Guidance

Some pages with text areas were missing the Markdown guidance, we added these in to the following pages:

- About the Accredited Provider
- Training with your organisation
- Training with disabilities and other needs

### 3. Removing Personal Qualities and Other Requirements

Whilst originally we were looking to break these sections down into seperate pages, further analysis showed that the content in the personal qualities and other requirements fields were commonly repeated across all courses - making them less useful to candidates who are looking for things that make courses different from one another.

We already surface information which is very similar to the content that providers are entering in personal qualities on the screen where candidates enter their personal statement. We feel that this is the most relevant place for this content in the journey.

We aren’t dropping columns because we’ll need to see the data for providers to see for courses in the past.

It is going to sit behind a feature flag

### 4. Changes to Course Details

As we had made some changes to title changes on other pages - this information on course details page was also updated.

There had also been some work done on the prototype which never went live, including:

- Removing the truncation so that all copy is visible
- Using the 'Tab' design for the Basic Details / Description links
- Removal of Personal Qualities
- Removal of Other Qualities

### 5. SEND checkbox to radio buttons

To match how the SEND option appears in the edit section, we changed the SEND question from a checkbox to radio buttons

### 6. Full Time or Part Time radio buttons to checkboxes

This has been changed from radio buttons to checkboxes to follow best practises. Users can now chose either or both.

### 7. Add a Second Language validation

Some validation has been added so that users cannot select the same language as a secondary option that they already selected as a primary option
