Research with teacher training candidates on [improving the ability to browse and search for courses]( /find-teacher-training/improving-the-ability-to-browse-and-search-for-courses-round-1-user-research/) found that they had trouble navigating large blocks of dense text (long-form content) as it was “unstructured”.

They also experienced challenges in locating key information needed to assess and compare courses. Long-form content was therefore redesigned in a prototype to improve usability and better meet the needs of candidates.

Therefore, research was undertaken with providers to elicit their feedback on proposed redesigns and to understand what impact such changes would have on them and their organisations.

## Research aims

There were 2 main aims of this research round:

1. To understand providers’ views on proposed changes to long-form course content in the Publish service
2. To understand the impact of the proposed changes on providers

As providers currently ‘roll-over’ course content from one teacher recruitment cycle to the next, a secondary aim of this research was to understand the ways in which this occurs.

## Who we spoke to

We spoke to 12 people who were the main users of the Publish service for their teacher training provider in England.

There were 10 providers in total represented in this round of research, broken down as follows:

- 2 Lead partners
- 3 Higher education institutes (HEIs)
- 5 School-centred initial teacher training organisations (SCITTs)

The providers we spoke to were of varying sizes (from a few dozen trainees to over a thousand) and operated at different scales (some locally and others nationally).

## Methodology

One-to-one, semi-structured interviews with users of the Publish service were conducted via Microsoft Teams.

Online interviews were conducted to allow participants to interact with the prototype that included redesigned elements to long-form course content.

Participants were also asked general questions including on their processes of ‘rolling-over’ course content from one teacher recruitment cycle to the next.

## What we tested

The prototype of the changes to the Publish service enable several areas to be tested for usability including the following 3 elements.

### 1\. Structure of course information

Relating to where candidates will train; what they will do on their school placements; what they will study; how they will be interviewed; what the fees are; and what financial support is available.

### 2\. Presentation of course information

Relating to question format; optionality of questions; variation in word limits; expandable links to guidance on formatting text; the couse information they wrote last cycle; and live preview of content before publishing.

### 3\. Structure and presentation of organisation details

Relating to why candidates should train with a particular provider and how the needs of those training with disabilities will be met.

## Iterations to the prototype during the round of research

Following feedback from participants early in the research round, the following iterations were made and further tested:

- content was restructured. For example, the “Where and how you will train” section was split into 3 separate sections to reduce the cognitive load on users
- guidance on formatting text was repositioned to make it more visible to users
- nudge content was introduced to encourage users to add content in specific areas
- the position of some questions was changed to give prominence to more important ones for example, school placement
- the form of some questions was improved to make more usable, for example the Where will interviews take place question including additional radio button options and detail
- some wording was changed to improve usability, for example to the preview section

## Findings relating to aim 1 of the research: to understand providers’ views on proposed changes to long-form course content in the Publish service

- **Organisational and course information:** providers’ conceptual understanding of organisational content and course content was correct (i.e. organisational contents sits across courses).
- **Question format:** the style of content creation through the form of responses to question was broadly well received. One provider, for example, described the question format as “very candidate friendly” (Participant 10) and another felt there was “no real crossover [duplication] between questions” (Participant 1).
- **Formatting guidance:** guidance on formatting text was useful to providers, particularly in its second iteration where its position changed (it was moved from the top right of the page to the top) and content was made expandable (it previously was not), and reference was made to what the guidance included (‘How to create links and bullet points’).
- **Content from previous cycle:** the ‘See what you wrote last cycle’ was noticed by most providers who found it useful to differing degrees, depending on their circumstances.
- **Preview:** most providers noticed the ‘Preview of what candidates will see’ and understood its purpose —to show exactly how their input would appear to candidates. This was particularly the case in the iterated version.
- **Nudge content:** content included under ‘How trainees will be assessed’ to encourage input was noticed by some providers and positively influenced how they completed this section.
- **Language:** the language of content was broadly clear and consistent with what providers had come to expect. However, in some cases, language was perceived to be focussed with certain provider types in mind, for example ‘study’, ‘modules’, and ‘theoretical training’ were not relevant to Participant 2’s SCITT
- **Word limits inconclusive:** although providers generally agreed there should be word limits to question responses, they disagreed on what those limits should be for each question. For example, some felt a limit of 50 words forced brevity and others thought it restrictive.

## Findings relating to aim 2 of the research: to understand the impact of the proposed redesigns on providers

The proposed changes to Publish were generally positively received by providers.

Depending on the size of the provider (the number of courses they offer) and complexity of context (the number of people approving content), rollover with proposed changes was estimated to take anywhere from 1 hour to 3 weeks.

Providers generally understood the value of proposed changes to candidates by helping them to avoid an overload of information and presenting information in a clearer format.

Although some providers did not see a direct benefit of changes to themselves, others thought more complete information could make their organisation more attractive to candidates.

Most providers were not aware that the date for rollover had been changed to early September.

Providers stressed the importance of early notification about changes, especially with the rollover date change, to allow adequate planning and team coordination.
Participant 5 described this as, “Give me as much information as possible as early as possible.”

## Findings relating to current ‘rollover’ processes

The current process for ‘rollover’ was generally described by providers in positive terms such as ‘easy’ (Participant 1) or ‘intuitive and smooth’ (Participant 4).

However, aspects of rollover were also ‘a little bit frustrating… [with] scope for changes’ (Participant 5). This typically centred on users’ inability to copy over course content across multiple courses.

Larger providers were particularly negatively impacted by this given the scale they were operating on.

Many providers said they worked on rollover during the summer holidays (Jul/Aug) when it’s quieter for them.

Content creation for rollover is a team effort for many providers involving colleagues both within and sometimes outside their organisation.

Many providers had offline processes relating to rollover. This included drafting content outside of Publish, meeting, discussing and agreeing content changes with other stakeholders, and maintaining a record of the latest content (often in Microsoft Word or Excel).

## Recommendations

The following recommendations were made as a result of this round of research:

- Overall the proposed design changes tested well with providers, so the team have decided to proceed with making these improvements to the service
- Proposed questions that formed part of the changes should be shared with providers well in advance of the teacher recruitment next cycle, preferably in an easy-to-use template
- A banner to promote rollover date change should be introduced in Publish and reiterated in further communication to providers to ensure this key information is not missed

## Next steps

All of those recommendations have already been implemented.
