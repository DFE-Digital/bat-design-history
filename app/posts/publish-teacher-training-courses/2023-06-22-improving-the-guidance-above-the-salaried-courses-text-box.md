From the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle, all providers will be able to offer salaried courses. We took this opportunity to review the guidance content above the salaried courses text box in Publish teacher training courses (Publish) to see if it can be improved.

## What we changed

We added some more guidance above the ‘Salary details’ text box in Publish to help providers know what to include in this section. We:

- renamed the section ‘Salary details’ and changed the text box label to match
- made the content more concise
- added a link to the [unqualified teachers’ national pay scales](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-pay-scales-for-eligible-teaching-and-education-jobs/national-pay-scales-for-eligible-teaching-and-education-leadership-occupation-codes) to help providers access this information quickly
