This design [tweaks the previous wizard](/publish-teacher-training-courses/new-course) so that:

- fees and salary have their own page
- there’s a route into creating a course
- course creation has a success message
- the created course page has no UCAS section
- there’s a read only course information section
- the confirm page only shows parts relevant to the journey taken

## User research

[Analysis and write-up on Confluence](https://dfedigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BaT/pages/762609665/Analysis+and+write+up) and [Research presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ImIHrXYtxKQwYa4LBOQQMHrl-WCq3Ke3UQmBcYDZiO4/)

We tested with 6 providers. Some journeys excluded language, training location, fee and salary and accredited provider screens because they weren’t appropriate.

- [University of Wolverhampton](https://lookback.io/watch/gYu2aoCo3PWyaJEHH)
- [Sheffield Teaching School Alliance](https://lookback.io/watch/QjevW5d7ahX57csvf)
- [Canterbury Christ Church University](https://lookback.io/watch/RrMJ6CkbkXkrQ49Hk)

Providers found adding a new course easy to do:

- [“It’s an easier to use system, seemed quicker”](https://lookback.io/watch/gKCGDj8zDhCiqwQ77?t=1h15m15s)
- [“This looks much clearer”](https://lookback.io/watch/gYu2aoCo3PWyaJEHH?t=50m26.78s)

### Course codes

Keele told us stories of users applying for the wrong course because they had the wrong course code. Many of them are different by 1 digit. [They are too hard to differentiate](https://lookback.io/watch/gKCGDj8zDhCiqwQ77?t=28m46s).

They want the course codes to be more clearly related to a provider: [“Can the codes be related to a provider? … We use KNST a lot”](https://lookback.io/watch/gKCGDj8zDhCiqwQ77?t=29m7s)

The University of Wolverhampton have UCAS course codes but also use their own internal codes which cover postgraduate and undergraduate courses. They are longer (eg [SE016P01UVG](https://courses.wlv.ac.uk/course.asp?code=SE016P01UVG)) and don’t appear to be surfaced to candidates.

[Some courses are known by their codes](https://lookback.io/watch/gYu2aoCo3PWyaJEHH?t=18m19.94s), perhaps because they’ve had the same code for a long time. This suggests that changing codes for existing courses might create a new mental burden for providers.

### Modular, or not modular?

Keele said, [“Ours is always no, we don’t do a modular course … I don’t know how it’d make a difference … We’ve never done it, we’ve never looked into what it means … If we don’t understand, how will candidates know?”](https://lookback.io/watch/gKCGDj8zDhCiqwQ77?t=1h12m24s)

University of Wolverhampton said, [“Ours are all modular … we have 6x 20 credit modules … I think that can be explained through the blurb [though]”](https://lookback.io/watch/gYu2aoCo3PWyaJEHH?t=49m3.97s)
