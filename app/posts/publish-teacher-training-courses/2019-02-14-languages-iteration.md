Providers model their modern languages courses differently.

For example:

- One modern language course for all languages they offer
- A separate course for each language, or language combination
- Sometimes pairs of languages have a hierarchy – a dominant language and one or more other languages
- Sometimes the languages are equal

The original design only catered for the dominant use case. For MVP we can ask for all of the languages on offer without inferring anything.
