Both a survey and one interview was done on the 2024 Performance Report

### Key Findings

- The order, layout and content of the report was mostly reported to be logical, useful and easy to understand

- Providers would find it useful if they could share the report with other stakeholders who don't have access to Manage

- The data within the report may present a misleading picture of the providers recruitment performance due to the absence of content

- Providers would use the report to
  - Understand more about application patterns and gaps, particulary around subject area
  - Compare theier performance data with national data but would find it useful they could filter by geographical location

- The ability to filter for specific data would be useful
  - Internation and UK applications
  - Location to allow geographical comparison

- Most sections of the report are useful however the purpose and value of the '30 days' section could be unclear

### Next Steps

- Create ticket to conduct a second round of user research to review provider use of the recruitment performance report and collect more feedback

- Action recommendations which are in scope to action

- Monitor support tickets / other feedback routes
