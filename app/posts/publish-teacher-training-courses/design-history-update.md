Research with teacher training candidates on [improving the ability to browse and search for courses](/find-teacher-training/improving-the-ability-to-browse-and-search-for-courses-round-1-user-research/) found that they, had trouble navigating large blocks of dense text (long-form content) as it was “unstructured”.
They also experienced challenges in locating key information needed to assess and compare courses. Long-form content was therefore redesigned in a prototype to improve usability and better meet the needs of candidates.  
Providers of teacher training courses create and publish content (via the Publish teacher training courses service) that candidates consume on the Find service.
Therefore, research was undertaken with providers to elicit their feedback on proposed redesigns and to understand what impact such changes would have on them and their organisations.
