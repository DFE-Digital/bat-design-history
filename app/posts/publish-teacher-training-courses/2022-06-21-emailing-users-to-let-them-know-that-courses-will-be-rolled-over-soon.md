On 10 June 2022, we emailed all Publish users to tell them that their courses for the 2022 to 2023 academic year will soon be rolled over to the 2023 to 2024 academic year.

## What we changed

We updated the rollover 2021 email significantly. Last year, we needed to tell users about several new features in Publish, such as selecting if a minimum degree classification is required and adding a UK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN).

This year, the email is more concise and the key messages are that:

- courses will be rolled over on 7 July 2022
- there will be a new section called ‘Recruitment cycle 2022 to 2023 - current’
- there will be improved guidance for course descriptions

We also asked providers if they’d like to take part in a survey about changes we’re making to Publish.

  subject: "Get ready for the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle",

In October, courses for the 2023 to 2024 academic year will be published on Find postgraduate teacher training.

In preparation for this, we’ll soon be making some changes in Publish teacher training courses to allow you to update and publish courses for the new recruitment cycle.

# Rolled over courses

On Thursday 7 July, we’ll duplicate all your current courses in Publish.

https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk

All courses which were published or withdrawn this recruitment cycle will be rolled over to the new cycle ready to be updated and published.

From 7 July, you’ll see a new section in Publish titled ‘Recruitment cycle 2022 to 2023 - current’. You can then:

- add new courses
- update rolled over courses
- delete any courses you’ll no longer be running

Also, you’ll find some improved guidance on what information to include in your course descriptions. This is based on our research into what candidates are looking for when they are browsing course page.

# Next steps

We are making some changes to the structure of course information to help candidates easily distinguish between courses on Find. We would like your feedback on these changes before rollover begins.

Please register your interest to take part by Wednesday 15 June at https://forms.gle/jXiGgJc3QkzwAXih7.

We’ll be in touch again in July to let you know that the courses have been rolled over.

If anyone else in your organisation needs to see this email, please forward it to them. If you need any help, contact us at becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk.

## Future considerations

We created an email plan for rollover 2022. We used the emails sent in rollover 2021 as the basis for this, as we know from user research that the emails sent last year were well received. We’ve drafted the emails and made content improvements.

We plan to send four more emails as part of our plan:

- When courses are rolled over - July
- First reminder email - September
- Second reminder email - September
- Third reminder email - October
