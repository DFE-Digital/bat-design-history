The original choice between we are the accredited body versus another organisation is not a valid question. For School Direct they will always need an accredited body. For SCITTs and universities, they are accredited.

Update the design so that:

- the original choice is removed, removing the opportunity for error
- there’s a default list of accredited bodies they’ve worked with before – minimising the chance of choosing the wrong organisation
- a new accredited provider can be used, if explicitly chosen
