## The issue

Research found that school information in Publish such as school name and address was not always accurate.

This may be because we were asking providers to manually add schools and school information.

## What we changed

### Adding a school

We removed the ability to manually add school information, and replaced it with the ability to find a school that is on [Get Information About Schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Search?SelectedTab=Establishments) using a unique reference number (URN) or a school name.

We added guidance to support providers when they are struggling to find and add a school from GIAS.

Instead of displaying the school details in text fields, we display the information using the [check answers](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/check-answers/_) pattern.

### Adding multiple schools

We also added the ability for providers to add multiple schools. This is something the support team were already able to do.

We added a button on the schools landing page.

We added the ability to find schools that is on Get Information About Schools (GIAS) using unique reference numbers (URNs). You can enter a maximum of 50 URNs.

We added guidance to support providers on how to copy URNs from a CSV or spreadsheet

We used [summary cards](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/summary-list#summary-cards) to display school details on the check answers page.

When a school cannot be found or has already been added, we display a warning message.

## Next steps

These changes will be made in Publish for providers to use during rollover and when they add new courses for the 2025/2026 recruitment cycle.
