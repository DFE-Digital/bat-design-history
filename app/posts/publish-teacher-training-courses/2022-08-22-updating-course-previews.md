When a provider drafts a new course in Publish teacher training courses (Publish), they can preview it before they publish it on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

## What we changed

We have:

- removed the primary navigation
- added a backlink to the course page
- improved the call to actions when content is missing

### Navigation

To make the course preview a more accurate reflection of the course on Find, we removed the service’s primary navigation and added a backlink to the course details page.

### Missing content

When a course is published, there are several required fields a provider must enter. We indicate these required fields in the preview using inset text and a call to action asking the provider to enter the information. The call to action links directly to the section they need to complete.
