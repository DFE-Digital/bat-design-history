When a provider drafts a new course in Publish teacher training courses (Publish), they can preview it before they publish it on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

The way we displayed previews in Publish was not consistent with the course pages in Find.

## What we changed

We have:

- updated the content to match Find
- removed the primary navigation
- added a backlink to the course page
- improved the call to actions when content is missing

### Navigation

To make the course preview a more accurate reflection of the course on Find, we removed the serviceâ€™s primary navigation and added a backlink to the course details page.

### Missing content

When a course is published, there are several required fields a provider must enter.

If the content is missing, we indicate required fields in the preview using inset text and a call to action asking the provider to enter the information. The call to action links directly to the section they need to complete.
