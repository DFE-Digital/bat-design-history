{% from "email/macro.njk" import appEmail %}

Publish sends notifications to accredited bodies so that they can keep student record systems up to date and in sync with UCAS.

Our [first round of notification templates](/publish-teacher-training-courses/notifications-mvp/) did not address all of their needs.

The [generic notification template](/publish-teacher-training-courses/notifications-iteration/#course-updated) was not flexible enough to address many of the changes made in Publish. In particular, it could not accommodate a scenario when more than one thing changed, or when part of a thing changed.

## Next steps

We need to understand more about the implications of switching off our sync with UCAS. How does this affect accredited bodies’ needs for notifications?

## Email templates

### Course updated

  subject: "((course_name)) (((course_code))) has been updated",
