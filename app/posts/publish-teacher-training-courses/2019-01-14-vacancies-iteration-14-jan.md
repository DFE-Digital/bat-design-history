An iteration on [an earlier design](/publish-teacher-training-courses/vacancies).

In this design we:

- highlight a destructive action with a red button (eg closing a course)
- add validation to closing or opening a course – some users left the page using the button
- made it explicit that a course was closed because there were no vacancies
- use ‘Close applications’ and ‘Re-open applications’ button text for clarity
- move the Find and Apply messaging above the button to prevent it being missed
