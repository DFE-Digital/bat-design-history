Designs for success messages shown after a successful save or publish.

## User needs

{% from "user-needs/macro.njk" import appUserNeeds %}
{{ appUserNeeds({ items: collections['user-need'] | slugs(tags)}) }}

Use links in messages to nudge users towards checking what theyâ€™ve just done. After saving, link to a preview to check. After publishing link to the live website to check that the course was published as expected.
