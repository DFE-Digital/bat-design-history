title: Draft of a read only version
description: An initial pass at what a read only view of the service could have looked like.

As part of preparing providers for the upcoming service we wanted to give them read-only access to the service so they could see what information was needed and begin writing their content.

The team instead chose to provide a document with guidance on the fields rather than a half built interface which would be confusing.

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [{
    text: "We imported",
    img: { src: "we-imported.png" }
  }, {
    text: "Courses",
    img: { src: "courses.png" }
  }, {
    text: "Course",
    img: { src: "course.png" }
  }, {
    text: "Course details from ucas",
    img: { src: "course-details-from-ucas.png" }
  }, {
    text: "About this course",
    img: { src: "about-this-course.png" }
  }, {
    text: "About this training provider",
    img: { src: "about-this-training-provider.png" }
  }, {
    text: "Course requirements",
    img: { src: "course-requirements.png" }
  }, {
    text: "Qualification",
    img: { src: "qualification.png" }
  }, {
    text: "Salary",
    img: { src: "salary.png" }
  }, {
    text: "Preview",
    img: { src: "preview.png" }
  }, {
    text: "Schools",
    img: { src: "schools.png" }
  }, {
    text: "Organisation",
    img: { src: "organisation.png" }
  }]
}) }}
