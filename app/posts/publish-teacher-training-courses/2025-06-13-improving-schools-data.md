## The issue

Research found that providers do not always have all the schools they partner with in Publish, and sometimes the information and addresses added are not accurate or not actual schools.

This may be because we were asking providers to manually add schools and school information.

We recently [changed how schools are manually added](/publish-teacher-training-courses/changing-how-schools-are-manually-added/), so now only schools that are on [Get Information About Schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Search?SelectedTab=Establishments) can be added.

However, there are still schools which were added before we made this change that are not on GIAS.

## What we changed

### Automatically adding and removing schools

As part of rollover, we plan to automatically remove schools that are not on GIAS, and automatically add all the schools a provider is working with. These are schools that are on [Register trainee teachers](https://www.register-trainee-teachers.service.gov.uk/).

Providers will no longer need to manually add all your schools to your account, but will still have the ability to manually add a schools, if needed.

### Communicating the changes at an account level

In order to make these changes, we needed to clearly communicate the changes to providers and what they need to do next.

We added a notification banner to the schools landing page.

The banner links to separate pages.

One page is the list of schools added.

The other page is the list of schools removed.

We added a tag to the schools added from register, so that providers could easily see which schools were newly added. We also display the same tag when attaching schools to courses.

### Communicating the changes at a course level

On the 'Courses' landing page, we added a notfication banner, which links to the schools landing page.

On the 'Basic details' tab of rolled over pages, we changed the 'Schools' row to make it mandatory to check schools before publishing a rolled over course.

### Improving how providers attach schools to courses

When attaching schools to courses, we added the option to select all schools.​ This is to help providers attach the relevant schools to each of their courses.​

## Next steps

These changes will be made in Publish for providers to use during rollover and when they add new courses for the 2025/2026 recruitment cycle.

Where we are communicating the changes to schools data, we will keep this guidance live until the end of October.

Similar guidance will need to be added to Publish at the start of rollover in 2026, however it will only need to communicate that schools have been automatically added. We will not need to remove schools next year, as schools can now only be added that are on GIAS.
