## The issue

Research found that providers do not always have all the schools they partner with in Publish, and sometimes the information and addresses added are not accurate or not actual schools.

This may be because we were asking providers to manually add schools and school information.

We recently [changed how schools are manually added](/publish-teacher-training-courses/changing-how-schools-are-manually-added/), so now only schools that are on [Get Information About Schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Search?SelectedTab=Establishments) can be added.

However, there are still schools which were added before we made this change that are not on GIAS.

## What we changed

### Automatically removing schools

As part of rollover, we plan to automatically remove schools that are not on GIAS.

### Automatically adding schools

As part of rollover, we plan to automatically add all the schools a provider is working with. These are schools that are on [Register trainee teachers](https://www.register-trainee-teachers.service.gov.uk/).

### Comunicating the changes to providers

To do this, we needed to clearly communicate the changes to providers, and what they need to do next.

We added a notification banner to the schools landing page.

The banner links to separate pages.

One page is the list of schools added.

The other page is the list of schools removed.

## Next steps

These changes will be made in Publish for providers to use during rollover and when they add new courses for the 2025/2026 recruitment cycle.
