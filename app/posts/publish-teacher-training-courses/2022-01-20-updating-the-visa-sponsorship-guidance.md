There are two types of visa:

- Student
- Skilled Worker

The type of visa a non-UK candidate will need depends on the type of course they are doing.

For fee-paying courses, candidates will need a Student visa.

For salaried courses, candidates need a Skilled Worker visa.

Read more information about the [different types of visas for students](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants/train-to-teach-in-england-if-youre-a-non-uk-citizen#visa).

Providers need more clarity on visa sponsorship. In the [previous iteration](/publish-teacher-training-courses/visa-question-wording-change/)we added guidance telling providers how they can become a visa sponsor.

Before becoming a sponsor, not all providers know:

- how visa sponsorship works
- if they are eligible to sponsor student or skilled worker visas
- if their accrediting body sponsors student visas

## What we changed

We updated the guidance to show:

- a more detailed explanation of visa sponsorship
- information on where to find out more

## Future considerations

In future we’ll consider:

- removing the visa sponsorship page for lead schools
- changing the visa sponsorship page for accredited bodies
- how to display visa sponsorship information on Find postgraduate teacher training

### Removing the visa sponsorship page for lead schools

Student visas can only be sponsored by [School Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT)](/glossary#school-centred-initial-teacher-training-(scitt)) or a [Higher Education Institute (HEI)](/glossary#higher-education-institution-(hei)).

We will remove the question, “Can candidates get a sponsored Student visa for your fee-paying courses?” for lead schools as it is not relevant.

Skilled Worker visas can be sponsored by lead schools, HEIs and SCITTs. Providers can decide whether they will sponsor a Skilled Worker visa for a salaried course on a course-by-course basis.

We will remove the question, “Can candidates get a sponsored Skilled Worker visa for your salaried courses?” for all providers and move the question into the new course flow.

This means that for lead schools, there will not be a visa sponsorship page in the ‘About your organisation’ section.

We will show student visa sponsorship information on the lead school’s ‘About your organisation’ page where their accredited bodies have answered the question.

### Changing the visa sponsorship page for accredited bodies

Accredited bodies (HEIs and SCITTs) can sponsor student visas for fee-paying courses.

We will consider keeping the visa sponsor page for accredited bodies. This page will only include the question, “Can candidates get a sponsored Student visa for your fee-paying courses?”.

We will consider removing the question, “Can candidates get a sponsored Skilled Worker visa for your salaried courses?” and ask it during course creation.
