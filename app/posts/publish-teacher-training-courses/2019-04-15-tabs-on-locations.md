As part of work looking into how a location might be deleted or removed, it became clear that it was difficult to see which courses a location was assigned to.

This design adds tabs, [like on courses](/publish-teacher-training-courses/course-tabs), for editing, courses using the location and the locationâ€™s history. It also adds a courses count to the main locations table, which deep link to the courses tab.
