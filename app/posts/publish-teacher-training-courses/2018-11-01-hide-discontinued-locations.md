The way we display non-running training locations in Publish teacher training courses (Publish) has confused some publishers (we’ve received Zendesk tickets about superfluous training locations on their courses, where the publisher did not understand that the location was discontinued and they did not need to do anything).

Also we show irrelevant info for those locations – this looks weird, eg vacancies on a suspended location.

## Hide confusing locations

This design hides all suspended or discontinued training locations behind a disclosure.

Inside the disclosure the listed locations only have their address and status, vacancies and apply dates are removed.
