We were inconsistent in how we refer to recruitment cycles in Publish teacher training courses (Publish).
We updated the content to match the way we refer to recruitment cycles in Manage teacher training applications (Manage) and to align with our Becoming a Teacher (BAT) style guide.

## What we changed

In Publish, we used the year the course starts and the year the course ends followed by ‘cycle’. For example, ‘the 2022 to 2023 cycle’. In Manage, we use the years in which candidates can apply. For example ‘2021 to 2022 recruitment cycle’.

To avoid confusion, we updated Publish wording and used the recruitment cycle dates to match Manage.

We also updated our emails to use the correct wording in line with our style guide.

When referring to the time period in which candidates can apply, we use ‘Recruitment cycle’ plus the dates. For example:

“The 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle is now open.”

“Recruitment cycle - `<year>` to `<year>`”

When referring to the time period in which the course is running, we use ‘Academic year’ plus the dates. For example:

“The 2022 to 2023 academic year.”

“Academic year - `<year>` to `<year>`”
