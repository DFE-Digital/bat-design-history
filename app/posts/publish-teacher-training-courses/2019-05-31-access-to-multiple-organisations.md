Providers can already [manage multiple organisations from a single account](/publish-teacher-training-courses/multiple-organisations). But only providers who have this set up will know about this feature. There are users who donâ€™t know they can do this who are using multiple logins to manage organisations.

We discovered this while researching with accredited bodies: [Research video](https://lookback.io/watch/xG4kWc75pZTTj5pgb?t=3m37.92s)

## Suggested changes

* All users see the organisations page, rather than just multiple organisation users
* At the bottom of the list we call out how to get access to more organisations

This should also simplify the logic for the current systems.
