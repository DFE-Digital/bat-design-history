> **These designs were not built, or progressed further**

As part of a wider content audit of the service, we wanted to improve the comprehension and clarity of the content on the “Courses” pages.

We also wanted to ensure the content meets the [GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style)

User research with providers found that some participants were uncertain how to:

- add courses
- remove courses
- edit courses

## What we changed

We have:

- updated the section titled “Courses” on organisation overview page
- removed content from the courses list
- changed the help text on about this course

### Organisation overview page

We changed the bullet points that introduce the Courses section. Users can now scan the page for the keywords to add, remove and edit courses.

- add and remove courses
- edit, preview and publish courses
- assign locations to a course
- copy content between courses

### Courses list

We removed the bullet point list as it was repeating the content on the overview page, so it was unnecessary.

### Course information page

We changed:

- the title to “Course information” to distinguish it from the “About this course” field
- all instances of “applicant” to “candidate” so that the terminology is consistent with other BAT services
- all negative contractions, for example, “cannot” to “cannot”
- all instances of “e.g.” to “for example”

We removed a bullet point advising the user to make course content unique and to not copy from other courses. We have the functionality to copy content from a course, so this advice was contradictory.

## Future considerations

On the Organisation overview page, we will review the introductory content for the other sections.

We will remove the grey boxes and review and reposition the contents.

We will change [the way we refer to cycles](/manage-teacher-training-applications/referring-to-recruitment-cycles/) in Publish to align with Manage.

The ‘Course information’ page is one of the key pages in Publish. We will continue to discuss how to improve the way we collect course information from providers. We’ll use Publish and Apply user research to help us balance provider needs (what providers want to tell candidates) and candidate needs (what candidates want to know). This is an ongoing project.
