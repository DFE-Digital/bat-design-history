We recently made changes to Publish teacher training courses (Publish) and Support for publish teacher training courses (Support) to use Get information about schools (GIAS) data for addresses. This change introduced ‘Address line 3’ to all addresses.

## What we changed

We have:

- added 'Address line 3' to the contact details form
- aligned the contact details form with the equivalent form in Support
- updated the form validation
