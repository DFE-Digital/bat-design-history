## The issue

Two of our core user groups for Find teacher training courses are career changers and international candidates.

We know from previous research that these users may find it difficult to do face-to-face interviews. So in order to support them to apply for teacher training courses that meet their needs, we need to be clear whether a course can offer online interviews.

Some providers were already supplying this information in the ‘Interview process’ field on Publish, but it was very inconsistent. Even when they did mention whether or not they offered online interviews, this information was often difficult to find as it was hidden within a large free text field.

Analysis shows that courses which include the word ‘online’ in the ‘Interview process’ section receive more applications on average. This is particularly true for SCITTs.

This is how the ‘Interview process’ field used to look on Publish:

And this is how the ‘Interview process’ field used to look on Find:

## What we tested in user research

### Testing on Publish

We tested changes to Find with candidates, and changes to Publish with providers. We did this as part of the bigger [structuring course content user research with candidates](https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/find-teacher-training/structuring-couse-content-user-research-with-candidates/) and [user research with providers on redesigns to course content]( /publish-teacher-training-courses/user-research-with-provider-on-redesigns-to-course-content/).

With providers, we tested a new optional field on Publish where the provider could indicate where their interviews would take place. We tested with 10 providers from a mixture of accredited school-centred initial teacher training organisations (SCITTs) and higher education institutions (HEIs) as well as non-accredited training providers.  

We tested several iterations of this question and it became clear that it was important for providers to have three options – in person, online, or either in person or online. We also learned that providers who offer online interviews sometimes only do so on a case-by-case basis. So we added the line ‘Depending on individual circumstances’ to take this into account, and this tested well with providers.

This was the final iteration to the design on Publish:

### Testing on Find

We also tested surfacing this information to candidates on Find.

This is what candidates would see if providers chose the option ‘Online’:

And this is what candidates would see if the provider chose the option ‘Either in person or online’:

If the provider chose ‘In person’, no inset text would appear for candidates.

This all tested well – participants generally found the online interview status helpful, especially for those relocating or needing flexibility.

We also tested being able to filter for courses which offer online interviews. This also tested well.

## What we changed

Based on the feedback from user research, we decided to go live with the designs above for both Publish and Find.

We are aiming to go live with the Publish changes before September 2025 (ahead of rollover) and with the Find changes before October 2025 (the start of the new cycle).

## Next steps

We will deploy these changes to both Publish and Find, and then monitor whether providers actually use the new online interview question as it’s optional.

If the uptake is low we will do research to find out why, and iterate our designs.
