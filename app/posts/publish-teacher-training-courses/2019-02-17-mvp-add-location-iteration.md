The term ‘training locations’ is ambiguous.

Providers can misinterpret what ‘training locations’ should mean. The data we want to capture is specifically a set of locations that candidates will choose between when they apply.

Training locations is used in the UCAS application and on Find.

This design tries to fix this by:

- renaming ‘training locations’ to ‘locations’
- adding content about candidates selecting these locations
- providing a definition with a link to further guidance
- checking the meaning is understood at the point of adding a location (using a checkbox)

Success messages after saving and edited have been added, these reinforce the message and give routes to editing courses.
