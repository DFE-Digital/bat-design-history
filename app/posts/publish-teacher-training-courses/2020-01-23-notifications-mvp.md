title: Notifications MVP
description: Identifying an initial set of notifications and the critical user flows required to manage notifications in Publish teacher training courses
date: 2020-01-23
tags:
 - notifications
 - emails
---
UCAS provided email notifications to it’s users. This functionality is yet be introduced to Publish teacher training courses (Publish). To address this, we established an introductory set of notifications to satisfy our user’s critical needs.

We learned through the [accredited bodies research](/publish-teacher-training-courses/accredited-bodies-research-round-2#a-need-for-notifications) that there was a need for notifications to be sent to accredited bodies about changes made in Publish.

## User needs

{% from "user-need/macro.njk" import appUserNeed %}
{{ appUserNeed({
  description: "As an accredited provider
  I need to be notified of changes by providers to courses I ratify
  So that I can keep my student record system up to date and in sync with UCAS"
}) }}

## Critical notifications

Events that would initiate a notification were identified:

1. A course has a basic detail change
2. A course is created
3. A course is published
4. A course is withdrawn
5. There are no more vacancies in a course (different from withdrawing)
6. A course’s accredited body has changed

## Critical user journeys

User journeys required to facilitate notifications were identified:
The recipient needs to be able to:

- opt in and opt out of notifications
- update notifications settings (change email address etc)

These tasks were deemed outside of our MVP and would be managed manually, with users contacting support, [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk).
