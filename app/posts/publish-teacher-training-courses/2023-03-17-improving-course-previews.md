We updated the draft course previews in Publish teacher training courses (Publish) to make it easier to see and update missing content.

## What we changed

We have updated the:

- preview banner
- edit call to action in each section
- static content

We also removed the disabled ‘Apply for this course’ button since it was unnecessary.

### Preview banner

We updated the preview banner to say:

^This is a preview of how your course will appear on Find.

### Edit call to actions

We include edit links for:

- Course summary
- School placements
- Entry requirements - separate links for degree and GCSE requirements
- Salary - if the course is salaried
- Fees and financial support
- About the training provider
- About the accredited provider - if a training partner runs the course
- Interview process
- Training with disabilities and other needs

When a user selects one of the edit links, they are taken to the appropriate section, where they can add the required information. Once updated, they return to the course preview with the new information shown.
