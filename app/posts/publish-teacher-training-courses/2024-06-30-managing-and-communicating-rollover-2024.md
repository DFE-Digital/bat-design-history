On 16 July 2024 we copied all  courses which were published in the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle  (including those which were subsequently withdrawn) to the new 2024 to 2025 recruitment cycle. This process is known as rollover. 

Providers can edit and publish their rolled over courses so that they will appear on Find teacher training courses (Find) at 9am on 1 October when the new cycle begins. 

## Contacting providers about rollover  

### Before rollover 

We emailed all providers on 14 June to tell them about the [changes we had made to Publish](changes-we-made-to-the-service-in-preparation-for-rollover-2024) and how this would impact them during rollover.  

{{ appEmail({

Hello,

In July, your courses on Publish teacher training courses (Publish) will be ready to be rolled over to the 2024 to 2025 recruitment cycle.

We will email you again when you need to sign in to check and publish or delete your courses.

We want to tell you about some other changes for the 2024 to 2025 recruitment cycle:

* There is a new undergraduate salaried route into teaching called the Teacher Degree Apprenticeship (TDA).
* We have made some changes to Publish to make it easier to update and publish courses and for candidates to find the right course for them.

## Rolled over courses

Courses that were published in the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle will be rolled over to the new cycle ready to be updated and published. This includes courses which were withdrawn after they were published.

[Find out more about how rollover works](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/how-to-use-this-service/roll-over-courses-to-a-new-recruitment-cycle)

## Teacher Degree Apprenticeship (TDA)

The TDA is a new salaried undergraduate programme which opens for recruitment for the 2024 to 2025 recruitment cycle.

Providers offering the TDA will be able to add TDA courses to Publish during roll over. The TDA is a degree and QTS awarding apprenticeship so candidates do not need an existing undergraduate degree to apply.

Changes have been made to Publish to accommodate the TDA and to prevent candidates without an undergraduate degree applying to postgraduate courses.

## Changes to Publish

Following research with training providers and candidates plus some data analysis, we have made improvements to the Publish service.

The changes aim to make it easier for you to create and update courses and for candidates to find the courses that best suit them.

## Relocated personal qualities to Apply

### Research and analysis

* Candidates want information that makes courses distinct from one another rather than things that are the same across different providers.

* Data analysis showed that personal qualities information was consistent across most providers with 90% including terms such as passion, commitment, resilience and enthusiasm.

* Candidates find this information most relevant and useful when they are applying for courses, rather than on course pages.

### What we have done

We have included the terms we saw in our analysis in the guidance for writing a good personal statement in the Apply for teacher training service (Apply).

The personal qualities have not been lost, they will be in a place in the application journey that makes most sense and has most impact. You will not need to add personal qualities to courses, but you can see what you entered in previous cycles.

## Removed the other requirements field

### Research and analysis

Most of the text entered in the other requirements field is about the mandatory checks before an offer of training can be taken up.

### What we have done

Information about DBS checks is already in the Apply service when candidates declare any safeguarding issues. It is also on the start page for both the Find and Apply services.
We will be adding information about the checks throughout the candidate journey, from Get Into Teaching to their interview invitation.
It’s not necessary for you to enter it each time you publish a course, but candidates can still see this information.

## School placements and study sites

### Research and analysis

* Providers who list all of their school placements as well as study sites appear in more search results and receive more applications.

* You have told us you can’t confirm all school placements at the start of the cycle. For some of you, we know it’s an administrative burden to enter all school placement locations.

* Candidates do value location information but don’t always understand when training locations will be confirmed.

### Our advice for the 2024 to 2025 recruitment cycle

You should add school placements as soon as you know of them to make sure your courses are visible in as many searches as possible to attract good candidates.

### What we will do

We are working on ways to improve this experience for everyone. We will continue to review how to communicate location information to candidates to better manage their expectations.

## Next steps
We will email you again in July to let you know when courses have been rolled over. In the meantime, you could start preparing your course information and descriptions ready to be added or updated.

You could also read through our [guidance on how to use the Publish service](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/how-to-use-this-service).

We also emailed a specific group of providers who had added text to the optional fields ‘Fee details’ and ‘Financial support.’ As part of the work we did to improve Publish, we merged these fields into a new field called 'Fees and financial support'. This was because analysis showed that people were tending to enter all financial support information in the ‘Fee details’ field and that it repeated content that is automatically rendered on the page about financial support. 

Merging these fields would take some of the content over the word count meaning the content would be cut short. To mitigate against this we emailed them to ask them to follow these steps:
#### Before rollover
* copy the content in an existing course
* edit it so that it falls below the word count 

#### At rollover
* enter it into the new ‘Fees and financial support’ field of a single course
* use the copy course content functionality to copy it across all courses 

{{ appEmail({

Hello,

You are receiving this email because you, or at least one of the training providers you work with have published financial support information on your 2024 courses.

Research showed us that the optional fee details and financial support fields often contained the same information. This repetition makes the course pages harder for candidates to use.

We have merged these fields into a new optional field called ‘Fees and financial support’. This means that for this year only, there may be too many words in the merged field unless the content is edited to fit within the 250 word limit.

## What do you need to do
### Before rollover

1. Find a 2024 course that you have added fee details and financial support information to.
2. Copy both the financial support and fee details content into your own document.
3. Do a word count.
4. If it’s more than 250 words, edit the financial support content so that it is less.

### At rollover

1. Go to the rolled over 2025 courses and select one.
2. Open the fees and financial support (optional) field and paste your edited fees and financial support content in.
3. Select ‘Update fees and financial support’.

You can now use the ‘copy course content’ function to copy this updated content to all of your other rolled over courses, so you will only need to manually copy and paste it once.

### At rollover 

We emailed providers again on 16 July once rollover had taken place to tell them that their courses were ready to be checked and published. 

This email also highlighted some behaviours that we want to encourage in providers:  

* Make course descriptions specific. 
  Research with candidates has shown that they prefer course descriptions which are unique so that they can compare different courses effectively. 

* Format text using Markdown. 
  We know Markdown isn’t the most intuitive way to format content, but we have included new guidance to encourage providers to format links and bullets properly. 

We also wanted to highlight the functionality that allows providers to review and preview courses because research showed us they are not always aware of this. 

{{ appEmail({

Hello,

All courses that were published this recruitment cycle (including courses that had been withdrawn) have now been rolled over to the new cycle (2024 to 2025) ready to be edited and published.

Courses that you publish will be searchable on Find teacher training courses (Find) from 9am on 1 October. Candidates can apply for courses from 9am on 8 October.

[Sign in to Publish teacher training courses (Publish)](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/sign-in) and on the ‘Recruitment cycles’ page, select ‘2024 to 2025’.

You can then:

* add new courses
* check and edit rolled over courses
* delete any courses you are no longer running
* publish courses so that they will be searchable on Find from 1 October.

Courses with the status ‘rolled over’ are ready to be edited and published now.

[Guidance on rolling over courses to a new recruitment cycle](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/how-to-use-this-service/roll-over-courses-to-a-new-recruitment-cycle).

^ This year we have produced some video guidance. [Watch this guide to rolling courses over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J_ddG9Y0B8).

## Updating courses

Check that:

* Essential information, such as fees and visa sponsorship, is up to date.
* Your course descriptions are specific and give candidates a good overview of what to expect. 
    They have told us they like to know about training modules, course structure, mentoring and support.

^ [Get help writing course descriptions](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/how-to-use-this-service/help-writing-course-descriptions). Watch this [guide to writing good course descriptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vslH7U-kuEY)

* Content is formatted well. Line breaks and bulleted lists make text easier to read. Make sure any links you have included have been formatted correctly so that candidates can click on them.

There is guidance in Publish to help you with formatting. You will see it above each text field.

^ Watch this [guide to formatting your text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmRYOVxlwT0).

## Publishing courses

Use the ‘Preview course’ link on the course page to see how the course will look to candidates on Find before publishing it.

^ Watch this [guide to reviewing and previewing courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV_gK9Hvx4U).

When you are happy with your courses, you can publish them. The status will change to ‘Scheduled’ and they will be automatically displayed on Find when it opens in October.
You do not need to specify a different open date for your course unless it’s beyond October 2024.
You can still make changes to your course descriptions after publishing them, but it’s a good idea to get them scheduled as soon as possible.

## Adding other people to your account

If your organisation has changed its relationship with a partner organisation, you can add or remove users from the account. You can also add any new colleagues who might need to be involved in publishing courses.

[Find out more about adding and removing users](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/how-to-use-this-service/add-and-remove-users).

### Video guidance 

User research with providers told us that they would appreciate guidance in other formats than the email we send at rollover. 

This year we produced 4 screen recordings and uploaded them to the [Becoming a teacher YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@becomingateacherfindapply8126). We included links to the videos in the rollover email. 

* [How to rollover your courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J_ddG9Y0B8) 
* [How to write good course descriptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vslH7U-kuEY) 
* [How to format your content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmRYOVxlwT0)
* [How to review and preview your courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV_gK9Hvx4U)

Depending on how many views these videos get, we could consider this format for future guidance.
