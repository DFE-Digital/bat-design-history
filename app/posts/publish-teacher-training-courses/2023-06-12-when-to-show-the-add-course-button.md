When a provider is onboarded to Publish teacher training courses (Publish) and a user first signs in, they cannot immediately add courses until they have entered:

- a school
- a study site
- an accredited provider - if the provider is a training partner
- visa sponsorship details

If they have not entered these details, we hide the ‘Add course’ button and replace it with content explaining what they need to do.

For example, if the provider is a training partner, and they have not added schools, study sites or details about their accredited provider, we show:

> Before adding a course, you need to:
>
> - [add a school](https://www.example.com)
> - [add a study site](https://www.example.com)
> - [add an accredited provider](https://www.example.com)

We only show links to content that is missing.
