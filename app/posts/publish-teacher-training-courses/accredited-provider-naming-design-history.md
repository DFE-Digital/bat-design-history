The Publish teacher training courses (Publish) team wanted to address inaccuracies and inconsistencies in provider naming practices on the Publish service. The aim was to do this by designing and introducing a provider naming policy.

The desired outcome was reduced confusion for candidates when searching for courses and trying to understand provider relationships.  

During this process, the Register of training providers (RoTP) service was also launched. This new Register aims to address common data challenges faced by the Department for Education (DfE) and the Becoming a teacher (BAT) service line.

DfE services often require access to accurate and up-to-date data on training providers. However, teams frequently encounter issues such as:

- difficulty sourcing data from multiple sources, leading to inefficiencies
- outdated or inconsistent data that we cannot fully trust
- the need to clean and standardise data before services can use it effectively

Candidates also find provider relationships confusing, and inconsistencies in naming mean they can struggle to understand who is responsible for their training, or to compare different providers.

To design the provider naming policy, we therefore:

- considered the Register of training providers
- identified existing issues with provider naming

## Overview

During the process, the naming policy was divided into rules for accredited providers, and rules for training partners. When analysing the impact of these two sets of rules, we discovered that the training partner rules would have a significant impact.

Consequently, we decided to run further consultation of the training partner naming rules before implementation and planned to implement just the accredited provider rules in September 2025 during roll over.

This policy for accredited provider names is for Becoming a Teacher (BaT) services, including:  

- Publish teacher training courses  
- Find teacher training courses  
- Apply for teacher training  
- Manage teacher training applications  
- Register trainee teachers  
- Register of training providers  

This policy outlines how accredited providers should name themselves when creating accounts on these services.

The purpose of this policy is to improve the data consistency between BaT services, reduce confusion for candidates on services, and to promote adherence to ITT criteria regarding provider relationships.

This policy also reinforces the aims of the Register of training providers.

## The Policy

- Accredited providers must use their operating name as published here: [List of providers accredited to deliver ITT from September 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accredited-initial-teacher-training-itt-providers/list-of-providers-accredited-to-deliver-itt-from-september-2024#contents) and [List of providers accredited to deliver ITT from September 2026](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accredited-initial-teacher-training-itt-providers/list-of-providers-accredited-to-deliver-itt-from-september-2026).  
  - If there is a reason why the operating name cannot be used, then legal names may be used instead.
  - If there are inaccuracies in the published list, providers should contact the DfE through <itt.accreditation@education.gov.uk> to amend these.
- Accredited providers must use the same name across all DfE services.  

## Next Steps

The policy will be used by support colleagues and the Publish team to correct existing issues with provider names and guide correct practice when creating new providers.

Accredited providers on the service who are impacted by the policy will be emailed by the team to inform them of the policy, given a choice of operating or legal name, and told the time period after which this change will be made.
