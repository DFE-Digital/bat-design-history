A small iteration on the [initial design](/publish-teacher-training-courses/check-ucas-data#request-access) adding a form legend, the new user’s organisation and success message.

We’d like to record whether the new user is part of the same organisation or a different one.

More about the request access process on the ticket: [BATSA-384](https://dfedigital.atlassian.net/browse/BATSA-384)
