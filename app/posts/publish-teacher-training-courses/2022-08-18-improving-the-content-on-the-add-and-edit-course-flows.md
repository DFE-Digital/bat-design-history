We improved the content on the add and edit course flows to make it clearer and more concise.

At the same time, we changed some of the interactions to make the process of adding and editing a course easier.

## What we changed

### Links and captions

We added ‘Back’ links to all pages in the ‘Add course’ flow, and ‘Cancel’ links to all pages in the ‘Add course’ and edit course flows.

We added a page caption to all pages which is dependent on whether a course is being added or edited.

- If a course is being added, we use ‘Add course’
- If a course is being edited, we use the course name and code, for example, ‘Biology (2KR6)’.

### Subject level

The title was not specific enough so we changed the title to ‘Subject level’.

This page contained another heading, ‘Special educational needs and disability (SEND)’ with ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ radio buttons. We removed this and created another page for this content within the ‘Add course’ flow.

### Subject

For both secondary and primary subject pages, we shortened the page title to ‘Subject’ and removed the hint text as it was uneccessary.

For primary subjects, we removed the dropdown list and replaced it with radio buttons as this is a more accessible way of presenting the options.

### Age range

We shorted the title to ‘Age range’ to make it more concise.

### Qualification

We shortened the title and used the terminology ‘Qualification’ to match Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

The radio button options were not in alphabetical order so we repositioned them.

### Funding type

We shortened the title, ‘Is it fee paying or salaried?’ to ‘Funding type’.

### Apprenticeship


### Full time or part time

We changed the title from ‘Study mode’ to ‘Full time or part time’ to make it more relevant to the options.

### Locations

We shortened the page title to ‘Locations’ and added hint text to make it clear that more than one location can be selected.

### Accredited body

We shortened the page title and ordered the list of accredited bodies alphabetically.

### Applications open date

We shortened the page title and updated the radio button labels.

Courses are published on Find around a week before Apply opens. We changed the first radio label to make it clear that this option relates to the date that candidates can apply from, rather than the date courses are published on Find. We did this by adding the date that Apply opens, for example, ‘On 11 October 2022 when Apply opens - recommended’.

### Course start date

We shortened the title to make it more concise. We removed the dropdown list and replaced it with radio buttons to make it more accessible.

We have changed date options for the radio labels to show the present month to the end of the following academic year, for example October 2022 to July 2024.

## Further considerations

We will explore how far into the future we need to go with the course start date options. We may look into automatically changing the date options month by month.
