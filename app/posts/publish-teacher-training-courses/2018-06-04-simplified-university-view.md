Universities are the simplest provider. There are no schools to apply to and [no course folding](/publish-teacher-training-courses/imported-from-ucas).

- remove schools link in header
- hide accrediting provider
- do not show any of the qualification or salary study option fields

We showed this to universities at the [UCET](http://ucet.ac.uk/) June meetup. Each table was given a printout of the screens below, which some commented on.
