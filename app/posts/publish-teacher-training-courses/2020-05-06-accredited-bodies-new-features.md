* See the courses you’re the accredited body for ([original design](/publish-teacher-training-courses/courses-as-an-accredited-body))
* Get notifications when courses are added or edited (a simplified version of the [initial design](/publish-teacher-training-courses/managing-notifications))
* Download a CSV of all the courses you’re the accredited body for

These features are based on research with accredited bodies:

* [Round 1](/publish-teacher-training-courses/accredited-bodies-research-round-1)
* [Round 2](/publish-teacher-training-courses/accredited-bodies-research-round-2)
