At the moment, when a user has not answered a question, we indicate this with the word ‘empty’.

To ensure we’re precise, we decided to use ‘not entered’. This phrase makes it more apparent that it’s about filling out a form field rather than giving details in some other way.

We are also more consistent with other services like Manage teacher training applications.
