One of the priorities for the initial teacher training (ITT) reforms is to make ITT less complex for providers, candidates and trainees.

## What we changed

In Publish teacher training courses (Publish), we have two ways of describing how courses are funded.

If the provider is a school, we show a ‘Funding type’ question with 3 options:

- Fee paying - no salary
- Salary
- Teaching apprenticeship - with salary

If the provider is a higher education institution (HEI) or school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT), we display the question, ‘Is this a teaching apprenticeship?’. This question has 2 options:

- yes
- no

Selecting ‘yes’ is the equivalent of selecting the funding type ‘Teaching apprenticeship - with salary’.

Selecting ‘no’ is the equivalent of selecting the funding type ‘Fee paying - no salary’.

We replaced the ‘Teaching apprenticeship’ question with ‘Funding type’ for all provider types, simplifying the ‘Add course’ and the edit course flows.

We also changed the ‘Fee paying - no salary’ option, removing the word ‘paying’.
