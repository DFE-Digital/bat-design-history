Progression of the minimum requirements page design:

- Started with a subject choice and a sensible default
- Added the ability to change the choice
- Remove subject choice, instead defaulting to legal minimums. Page only asks for preference
- Make it clearer that this affects UCAS Apply
- Simplify preference choice using a table
- Remove table and switch to two questions
- Split questions over two pages
