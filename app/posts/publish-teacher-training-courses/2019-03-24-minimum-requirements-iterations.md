title: Minimum course requirements â€“ iterations
description: A view of how the minimum requirements design has been iterated since December.
---
Progression of the minimum requirements page design:

* Started with a subject choice and a sensible default
* Added the ability to change the choice
* Remove subject choice, instead defaulting to legal minimums. Page only asks for preference
* Make it clearer that this affects UCAS Apply
* Simplify preference choice using a table
* Remove table and switch to two questions
* Split questions over two pages
