We have added an ‘Engineers teach physics’ question to the new course and the edit course flows.

## Why we’re doing this work

In February 2022, the Department for Education (DfE) launched the ‘Engineers teach physics’ programme as a pilot for the academic year 2021/2022.

The ‘Engineers teach physics’ programme aims to increase the number of physics teachers in England by attracting individuals with a background in engineering or material sciences to start postgraduate teacher training.

### The difference between ‘Engineers teach physics’ and physics courses

Whilst the ‘Engineers teach physics’ course content will mirror physics courses, we expect providers to tailor their course content and focus on bridging any subject knowledge gaps for non-physics graduates of engineering and materials science backgrounds.

Tailoring course content on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find) will give candidates the confidence to apply for the course by promoting how it meets their needs to become more effective physics teachers without a physics degree.

## What we changed

We made changes to the following:

- course titles
- add course flow
- edit course flow

### Course titles

We create course titles automatically from the list of subjects the user has chosen.

For example, if the user has chosen one subject – physics – the course title will be ‘Physics’. If the user has selected two subjects – physics and mathematics – the course title will be ‘Physics with mathematics’.

The course titles for the Engineers teach physics programme are an exception. If the user has chosen physics and the course is part of the programme, the course title will be ‘Engineers teach physics’.

If the user has chosen two subjects, the first is physics, and the course is part of the Engineers teach physics programme, the course title would be ‘Engineers teach physics with [additional subject name]’.

### Add course flow

In the add course flow, we added the question “Is this course part of the ‘Engineers teach physics’ programme?” if the first subject of the course is physics.

If the user answers ‘Yes’ to this question, the course title is pre-populated with:

- ‘Engineers teach physics’ if physics is the only subject
- ‘Engineers teach physics’ and a list of subjects if the user has selected multiple subjects - for example, ‘Engineers teach physics with mathematics’

If the user answers ‘No’ to this question, the name of the course is the subject.

### Edit course flow

User can change their answer to the ‘Engineers teach physics’ question from the course’s ‘Basic details’ page.

Changing the answer will also change the course title.

If the user changes the course subject to physics, they need to confirm if the course is also part of the ‘Engineers teach physics’ programme.

Answering ‘Yes’ to the “Is this course part of the ‘Engineers teach physics’ programme?” will change the title of the course as described in the [course titles](#course-titles) section.

## Further considerations

In future, we will consider how to:

- surface the ‘Engineers teach physics’ courses more easily on Find postgraduate teacher training
