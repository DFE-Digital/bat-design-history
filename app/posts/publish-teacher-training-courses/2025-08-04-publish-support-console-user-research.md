We carried out a round of internal research on the support console to identify areas of improvements, as previously support colleagues had identified areas for improvement.

During this round of research, we wanted to better understand the experience support agents have when using the support console and identify areas for improvement on Publish.

## Initial insights

Initial discussions with the Publish team revealed the following challenges that are impacting support agents:

- **Challenges with the onboarding process**
The current onboarding process for new users on Publish is done via MS Forms which has been described as “clunky” and not suitable.

- **Difficulty with navigation within the support console**
It can be confusing for support agents to understand the difference between the provider console and the support console. This needs clearer communication.

- **Issues with deleting “empty” providers from the Publish service**
The current process could be made more efficient through design changes.

## Support tickets

For this round of research, we analysed the support tickets raised by the Becoming a Teacher support team, conducted a survey of support agents, and carried out interviews with them to gather additional insights.

### Analysis of support tickets

The themes of the support tickets received were analysed in order to identify:

- What are the common issues being reported be users?
- What interventions/research can be done to reduce the number of support tickets?
- What improvements could be made to the way support tickets are categorised?

The analysis of the support tickets themes revealed:

- Recurring issues with editing course details and status suggest potential usability or workflow challenges in course management.
There is an opportunity to review how courses are managed on Publish, particularly in the aftermath of rollover changes. We aim to ensure provider experiences of rollover changes are effectively tracked and monitored.

- User onboarding has been identified as a high-volume support issue, potentially indicating that the current process is either unclear or overly complex.
It is recommended that future work explores improvements to the onboarding journey, including a review of how to transition away from Microsoft Forms.

- A significant volume of “no further action” tickets has been observed, potentially indicating misuse of the support system, limited availability of self-service resources, or poor issue categorisation.
  This trend suggests users may be engaging with the support console for inappropriate or unintended purposes.

### Recommendations from the analysis of support tickets

Two main recommendations arose from the analysis of support ticket:

1. Editing course details, status, and organisation fields generates a high volume of support tickets, indicating areas of friction within Publish.
There is an opportunity to review course management workflows to identify areas for improvement. Additionally, reviewing and enhancing current guidance for users may help reduce support demand related to editing these fields.

2. A high number of “no further action” tickets suggests potential issues with categorisation or ticket submission behaviour.
A review of how these tickets are classified could uncover opportunities to create more granular categories and better define user intent.

## Survey of support console agents

To examine the challenges around deleting empty providers from the Publish service, a survey was sent to several support agents.

This survey aimed to identify more efficient methods of deleting empty providers from the Publish service.

In total, 5 support agents responded to the survey.

Respondents shared suggestions and insights on improving the process:

- **Automation within the support console**
Several respondents suggested adding a button or feature to allow support agents to delete providers directly, reducing reliance on developers.

- **Reducing dependency on Trello and developers**
The current process involves raising Trello cards and waiting for developer action, which delays resolution.

- **Clearer onboarding/offboarding tools**
One respondent recommended an in-service form for new providers to streamline onboarding.

### Recommendations from the survey of support console agents

As a result of the research there are three main recommendations to consider:

1. Introduce a deletion feature in the support console to empower support agents and reduce developer workload.
2. Streamline onboarding/offboarding processes with integrated forms or workflows.
3. Review timing and frequency patterns to anticipate support needs during peak periods (e.g., September/October).

## Research interviews with support agents

Research interviews were conducted to understand the challenges that support agents experience when onboarding users.

The aim of the interview was to identify what improvements could be made to the current onboarding process.

Interviews with 2 support agents were conducted as well as informal chats via Slack with the support team.

The belowchallenges were identified.

### Challenges with on boarding

1. The current onboarding process for new users on Publish - delivered via Microsoft Forms - is inefficient and has been a source of confusion for some providers, particularly in relation to accreditation status.

2. Form completion issues are causing delays in the onboarding process, as some providers fail to confirm submission. Transitioning the onboarding process into the Publish service may help streamline this workflow and reduce delays.

3. It is recommended that future discussions be held with the design team to explore the feasibility and implementation of onboarding via Publish.

### Challenges with navigating the support console

- Support agents reported that it can be difficult to understand what view you are in when using the console.
It is not obvious to agents if they are in the support console or the provider console. The design of the console could be reviewed to identify how each version could be more clearly labelled.

- Support agents reported difficulties navigating in the support console.
When in the search function of the console, agents are unsure as to whether that’s what they can only view or what the can provider can view as well. Additionally, it’s difficult to understand which version of the console the agent is in. There is a need for a dedicated navigation button for the main research page.

## Key recommendations from the interviews with support agents

The below are the four main recommendations from the research with support colleagues:

1. Introduce a “delete” functionality in Publish to allow support agents to efficiently remove empty provider records. This should be tested and monitored with users to evaluate its effectiveness and ensure appropriate use.
2. Transition the onboarding process into the Publish platform, and conduct thorough testing with support agents prior to full rollout.
3. Review the categorisation of “no further action” tickets in Zendesk, with a view to introducing more detailed labelling. This may improve issue triaging and highlight where user expectations are misaligned with support provision.
4. Audit and improve user guidance within Publish, particularly around editing course and organisation information, to help reduce related support ticket volumes.
