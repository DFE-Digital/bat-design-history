We wanted to simplify how accredited bodies viewed their training partners and their courses.

Previously, accredited bodies could access courses published by their training partners in the ‘Courses as an accredited body’ section. They could not view complete course information in the service, only on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

## What we changed

We have:

- added a section to the primary navigation called ‘Training partners’
- updated the training partners list
- updated the courses list

We made these changes because:

- it gives accredited bodies one place to view their training partners and their training partners’ courses
- user research found that ‘partners’ was a term commonly used by participants to describe the accredited body relationship - we decided on ‘Training partners’ for additional clarification

## How it works

We added a section called ‘Training partners’, accessible via the primary navigation.

This section allows accredited bodies to view:

- existing training partner relationships
- the course details for each training partner course they ratify

### Viewing existing training partner relationships

We show a list of training partners in alphabetical order.

Each training partner links through to a page displaying the courses the accredited body ratifies.

### Viewing training partner courses

#### Courses list

We show a list of the training partner’s courses in alphabetical order.

For each course in the list, we show:

- course name - with a link to the course details
- course status - for example, draft, rolled over, published and withdrawn

If the course is published, we also show:

- if the course is on Find
- if the course is open to applications
- if the course has vacancies

#### Course details

For each course, we show:

- the training partner's name in a caption
- the course title and code in the heading
- the course status
- a link to the course on Find
- tabs for the course’s basic details and description

We do not show actions that would allow the accredited body to edit the course, including:

- change links
- the publish button - if the course status is ‘Draft’
- the withdraw link - if the course status is ‘Published’
- the delete link - if the course status is ‘Draft’

## Further considerations

We’re considering how accredited bodies manage their courses and those their training partners run.
