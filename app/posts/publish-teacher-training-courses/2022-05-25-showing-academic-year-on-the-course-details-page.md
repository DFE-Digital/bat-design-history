There is no clear way to distinguish courses that start in the current academic year from those that begin in the next.

We added the academic year as a hint next to the course start date so that providers know which academic year the course belongs to. It also helps to reinforce the distinction between the terms ‘Recruitment cycle’ and ‘Academic year’ used throughout the service.

The academic year determines what financial incentives are available to candidates. Showing providers this information will allow them to quickly see which academic year the course falls into and help them describe the fees, bursaries and scholarships available.
