We have revised the content in Publish teacher training courses (Publish) for ‘Engineers teach physics’ courses.

## What we changed

### GOV.UK engineers teach physics guidance

We have linked to the [GOV.UK guidance on offering an engineers teach physics course](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/offer-an-engineers-teach-physics-course) in the ‘Add course’ and edit course flows.

The text now says:

> Engineers teach physics is a new campaign to help engineers become physics teachers.
>
> [Find out how to offer an engineers teach physics course](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/offer-an-engineers-teach-physics-course).

### Degree subject requirements question

We have updated the hint text on the degree subject requirements question if the course is Engineers teach physics.

The hint now says:

> Candidates will be advised that their degree subject should match or be closely related to materials science or engineering.
