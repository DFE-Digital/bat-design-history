We chose `register-of-training-providers.education.gov.uk` as the domain name for the service. Like the [service name](/register-of-training-providers/naming-the-service/), the domain needs to be clear, descriptive, and trustworthy.

Using the full service name in the domain helps users:

- understand what the service is for before they click a link
- find the service more easily in search results
- recognise the service across GOV.UK and other communications

It also ensures consistency with the naming approach across other services in the Becoming a teacher (BAT) programme, such as:

- `publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk`
- `apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk`
- `register-trainee-teachers.service.gov.uk`

## Why we use ‘.education.gov.uk’

We will move to a `.service.gov.uk` domain once the service passes the necessary service assessments and enters public beta.

In the meantime, we will use a `.education.gov.uk` domain for private beta and internal testing. However, we designed the permanent domain name early to:

- reduce the need for redirects or renaming later
- establish a consistent identity in documentation and communications
- build trust with users by showing the service is official and part of the Department for Education

Getting the domain name right is part of designing the whole service, not just the interface. It helps users feel confident that they are in the right place and supports the wider GOV.UK design principles.
