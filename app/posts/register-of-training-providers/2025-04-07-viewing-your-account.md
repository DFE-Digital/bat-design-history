We added a way for Support users to view their account in the service.

[![Your account](your-account.png "Your account (select image to see a larger version)")](your-account.png)

The ‘Your account’ page includes a summary list including:

- first name
- last name
- email address

We do not allow users to change their details as they are managed via DfE Sign-in (or GOV.UK One Login if we were to use that service for user authentication).

We do not show the service navigation in the ‘Your account’ section because the navigation relates to the register, not a signed in user. Instead, we include a breadcrumb ‘Home’ that takes users back to the provider list.

In future, we will be able to use this section to:

- show permissions - if relevant
- manage email notifications
