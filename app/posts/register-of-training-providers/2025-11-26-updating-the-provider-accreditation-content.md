We updated the content and layout of the provider accreditations to make them more consistent and coherent with other parts of the service.

## What we changed

### Accreditation status label

We changed the “Accreditation type” label to “Accreditation status”.

This change more accurately describes the information. For example, an accreditation type might be ‘Initial teacher training (ITT)’ or ‘Early years initial teacher training (EYITT)’, whereas a status would be ‘accredited’ or ‘not accredited’.

### Accreditation dates layout and labels

We changed the layout and labels for the accreditation dates to be more consistent with how we collect and describe dates elsewhere in the service, for example, in the partnerships section.

We changed the form field labels from:

- “Date accreditation starts” to “Accreditation start date”
- “Date accreditation ends” to “Accreditation end date”

We updated the summary card layout to show the main label as “Accreditation dates” and secondary labels of “Starts on” and “Ends on”.
