In government, a ‘register’ is typically defined as an authoritative, regularly maintained source of information about a specific domain. In the context of becoming a teacher (BAT), a ‘Register of training providers’ must embody the following qualities to build trust and ensure reliable service delivery.

## Authoritative and accurate

- Serve as the single source of truth for details on training providers, such as official names and accreditation statuses.
- Validate data against credible references (for example, regulatory or accreditation bodies) to maintain reliability.

## Comprehensive coverage

- Include all providers relevant to the domain to reassure users and downstream services that the data is complete.
- Outline clear criteria for inclusion and exclusion, ensuring consistency.

## Stable unique identifiers

- Assign each training provider a permanent, unique identifier to enable straightforward referencing across systems.
- Use established reference numbers such as unique reference numbers (URNs) or UK provider reference numbers (UKPRNs) to avoid ambiguity and facilitate data integration.

## Clear data standards and schema

- Define required fields (for example, organisation name, location, provider type, accreditation status) and optional fields (like contact information or metadata).
- Maintain consistent formats and naming conventions, aligning with government data standards to simplify interoperability.

## Data governance and maintenance

- Appoint clear owners or stewards to oversee updates and audits, establishing accountability.
- Set out how often data will be refreshed and who will be responsible - providers, regulatory bodies, or a Department for Education (DfE) administrator.
- Include processes to resolve discrepancies and maintain data quality over time.

## Timeliness and currency

- Reflect changes to providers promptly—covering new providers, closures, mergers, and any status changes.
- Enable frequent updates and a mechanism for urgent corrections to preserve accuracy.

## Accessibility and ease of use

- Offer a user-friendly interface for public access and a well-documented application programming interface (API) for other systems to consume the data.
- Ensure the register meets accessibility standards so all users can effortlessly find and understand provider information.

## Interoperability and openness

- Where appropriate, make the register’s data freely available in open formats (for example, comma-separated values, JavaScript Object Notation) and through open APIs.
- Adopt common data standards and widely used identifiers to encourage adoption by both government services and external stakeholders.

## Security and privacy

- Comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), particularly if personal details such as named contacts are part of the register.
- Protect sensitive data while keeping the non-sensitive core of the register open if it aligns with policy objectives.
- Work with the DfE Office of the Data Protection Officer (ODPO) to ensure the register complies with all data protection laws and guidance.

A register is far more than a simple list: it is an authoritative, well-maintained data asset that underpins the quality and trustworthiness of public services.

By establishing robust governance, stable identifiers, and reliable processes for updates, a ‘Register of training providers’ can serve as a solid backbone for accurate, up-to-date information in the BAT service line.
