We created a simple start page as an entry point to the ‘Register of training providers’ service.

The start page describes:

- what the service is
- who can use the service
- what users need before they start

The page also includes a button to sign in to the service.

Currently, the service is only available to Department for Education (DfE) users, who must use DfE Sign-in to access it.
