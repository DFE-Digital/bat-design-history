We created a simple start page as an entry point to the 'Register of training providers' service.

## Why we did this

A start page helps users understand what a service does before they sign in. It sets expectations about:

- who the service is for
- what they can do with it
- what they'll need to use it

This follows the [GOV.UK pattern for helping users start using a service](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/start-using-a-service/).

## How it works

The start page is the first page users see when they navigate to the service.

### Page content

The start page describes:

- what the service is
- who can use the service
- what users need before they start

### Call to action

The page includes a green 'Start now' button that takes users to the sign-in page.

Currently, the service is only available to Department for Education (DfE) users, who must use DfE Sign-in to access it.

### What we do not include

Unlike public-facing GOV.UK start pages, we do not include:

- 'Before you start' sections with eligibility information
- links to alternative ways to access the service
- estimated completion times

This is because the service is an internal DfE tool, not a public service.

## Further considerations

We considered some changes that we did not implement. These included:

- hosting the start page on GOV.UK - this would require going through the GOV.UK proposition process, which is not necessary for an internal service
- adding more detailed guidance about what the service contains

*[DfE]: Department for Education
