We added a way for users to tell us what they think of the service.

## How it works

Users can access the feedback page from the ‘feedback’ link in the phase banner.

The feedback flow has 3 steps:

1. Feedback form
2. Check your answers
3. Confirmation

### Feedback form

The feedback form has 2 mandatory questions:

- Overall, how do you feel about this service?
- How could we improve this service?

The form also has 2 optional fields:

- full name
- email address

#### Overall, how do you feel about this service?

The ‘Overall, how do you feel about this service?’ question has 5 options:

- Very satisfied
- Satisfied
- Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied
- Dissatisfied
- Very dissatisfied

Users can rate their experience by choosing 1 option.

Users must answer the question. If they do not select an option, we show an error message:

> Select how you feel about this service

#### How could we improve this service?

The ‘How could we improve this service?’ is a free text box.

Users can give up to 200 words of feedback.

Users must answer the question. If they do not enter any details, we show an error message:

> Enter details about how we could improve this service

#### Optional name and email questions

We allow users to give us their name and email address if they would like a reply to the feedback.

If users enter their email address, but it is not the correct format, we show an error message:

> Enter an email address in the correct format, like <name@example.com>

We require an email address if users enter their name and vice versa.

#### Cancel sending feedback

Users can return to the home page by selecting the ‘Cancel’ link. If they do this, we do not save any changes.

### Check your answers page

The final step before submitting feedback is the ‘Check your answers’ page. We show a summary list containing the following:

- Overall, how do you feel about this service?
- How could we improve this service?
- Your name - if entered
- Your email address - if entered

Users can change any of the feedback details.

Users can return to the feedback form by selecting the ‘Back’ or ‘Change’ links.

If the user has not entered information, such as their email address, we show ‘Not entered’.

Once users select ‘Send feedback’, we show a confirmation page.

Users can return to the home page by selecting the ‘Cancel’ link. If they do this, we do not save any changes.

### Confirmation page

When a user submits their feedback, we show a confirmation page.

The confirmation page explains that if they provide their name and email address, we will respond within 5 working days.

## Further considerations

We considered some changes that we did not implement. These included:

- showing submitted feedback in the service to specific users
- using a third-party tool, such as a Microsoft form to collect the feedback

We will review these considerations when we have explored the user needs more.
