As we continue our work on the Register of training providers, we’ve taken time to step back and map out the different people and organisations with a stake in the service.

Understanding our stakeholders—who they are, their influence, and how the service impacts them is essential. It helps us design something that works for the right people, at the right time, in the right way.

We’re sharing the map here for transparency and to invite feedback.

## How we built the stakeholder map

We used a classic stakeholder mapping approach. We plotted how much the service will impact each stakeholder group on the horizontal axis. On the vertical axis, we plotted how much influence each group has over the service or how it runs.

The result is a map divided into four quadrants:

1. Manage closely (high impact, high influence)
2. Keep satisfied (low impact, high influence)
3. Keep informed (high impact, low influence)
4. Monitor (low impact, low influence)

## Who’s on the map

Here’s how we’ve placed our current stakeholder groups:

### Manage closely

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

### Keep satisfied

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

### Keep informed

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

### Monitor

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

This map is a living thing—it’ll evolve as we learn more and the service develops. If you think someone’s missing or in the wrong place, we’d love to hear from you.

## What’s next

Mapping stakeholders is just one step in understanding the broader ecosystem around this service. It helps us prioritise engagement, test ideas with the right people, and surface risks early.

We’ll keep updating the map and sharing our thinking as we go.
