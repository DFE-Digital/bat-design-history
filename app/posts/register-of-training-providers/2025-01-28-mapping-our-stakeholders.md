As we continue our work on the Register of training providers, we’ve taken time to step back and map out the different people and organisations with a stake in the service.

Understanding our stakeholders is essential: who they are, their influence, and how the service impacts them. It helps us design something that works for the right people, at the right time, in the right way.

We’re sharing the map here for transparency and to invite feedback.

## How we built the stakeholder map

We used a classic stakeholder mapping approach. We plotted how much the service will impact each stakeholder group on the horizontal axis. On the vertical axis, we plotted how much influence each group has over the service or how it runs.

To inform the map, we ran a series of workshops with colleagues from the Find teacher training, Apply for teacher training, and Register trainee teachers service teams. Each session helped us understand the stakeholders from that team's perspective: who they work with, who they rely on, and who rely on them.

We combined these perspectives to create a unified stakeholder map for the Register of training providers. This shared view helps us understand where there’s overlap, where responsibilities sit, and how the service fits into the wider initial teacher training (ITT) ecosystem.

The result is a map divided into four quadrants:

1. Manage closely (high impact, high influence)
2. Keep satisfied (low impact, high influence)
3. Keep informed (high impact, low influence)
4. Monitor (low impact, low influence)

## Who’s on the map

Here’s how we’ve placed our current stakeholder groups:

### Manage closely

These are stakeholders who are highly influential and highly impacted by the service. We need to involve them closely, collaborate often, and ensure that their needs and concerns shape the work.

- accredited providers
- Becoming a teacher (BAT) policy team
- Becoming a teacher (BAT) service teams
- Becoming a teacher (BAT) support team
- Market regulations team
- training partners
- [Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/teaching-regulation-agency)

### Keep satisfied

These groups hold influence but are less directly affected by the service. We should keep them in the loop and ensure their expectations are managed.

- DfE policy teams
- DfE Sign-in
- infrastructure team

### Keep informed

These stakeholders will feel the impact of the service but don’t have much influence over it. It’s important we keep them up to date and listen to their feedback.

- [Get Into Teaching (GIT)](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/)
- initial teacher training (ITT) funding team
- industry bodies - for example, the [National Association of School-Based Teacher Trainers (NASBTT)](https://www.nasbtt.org.uk/) and the [Universities Council for the Education of Teachers (UCET)](https://www.ucet.ac.uk/)
- Teacher Analytics Division (TAD)
- Teacher Records System (TRS)

### Monitor

These groups are less directly impacted and have less influence. We don’t need to engage them regularly, but we should be aware of them and monitor any changes in interest or influence.

- [Get information about schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/)
- [Ofsted](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted)
- software vendors
- [UK register of learning providers (UKRLP)](https://www.ukrlp.co.uk/)

This map is a living thing. It'll evolve as we learn more and the service develops. If you think someone’s missing or in the wrong place, we’d love to hear from you.

## What’s next

Mapping stakeholders is just one step in understanding the broader ecosystem around this service. It helps us prioritise engagement, test ideas with the right people, and surface risks early.

We’ll keep updating the map and sharing our thinking as we go.
