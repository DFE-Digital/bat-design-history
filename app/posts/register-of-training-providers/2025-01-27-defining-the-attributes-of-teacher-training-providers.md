Training providers in initial teacher training (ITT) can take various forms, including:

- accredited ITT providers
- training partners - also known as lead partners

You can read more about these relationships in an earlier post on [understanding provider relationships](/understanding-the-relationships-between-organisations-delivering-initial-teacher-training/).

Below is an overview of the attributes we use to identify and manage initial teacher training providers.

## Common attributes for all providers

We identified several attributes common to all provider types:

- Accreditation type - derived from the provider’s accreditation details
- Provider type - examples include school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT), higher education institution (HEI), school, and a catch-all category ‘other’
- Operating name - the name providers use in public-facing activities
- Legal name - the official registered name of the provider
- UK provider reference number (UKPRN) - an 8-digit identifier from the [UK register of learning providers (UKRLP)](https://www.ukrlp.co.uk)
- Provider code - a unique 3-digit alphanumeric code assigned by DfE.
- Address details - including:
  - Address lines 1, 2 and 3
  - Town or city
  - Country
  - Postcode
- Address identifiers - including:
  - Ordnance Survey’s unique place reference number (UPRN)
  - Google Maps’ ‘place ID’
- Geolocation - latitude and longitude, facilitating location-based searches on the ‘Find teacher training courses’ service
- Contacts - first name, last name, telephone number, and email address for provider contacts.
- Partnerships - details relationships between accredited ITT providers and their training partners

## Attributes specific to accredited ITT providers

Accredited ITT providers have an additional unique identifier:

- Accredited provider number - a unique 4-digit code issued by the Market Regulations team at DfE. Codes beginning with ‘1’ indicate HEIs, while those beginning with ‘5’ identify SCITTs. This number is time-bound: it has a start and end date.

## Attributes specific to training partners

Training partners have their own unique identifier:

- Unique reference number (URN) - a 5 or 6-digit number used to identify educational establishments, searchable via the [Get information about schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) service

## Attributes we considered but do not collect

We considered several additional attributes but found no clear user need to collect them. These included:

- type of contact
- local authority details
- local authority establishment (LAESTAB) number
- companies House number
- unique provider identification number (UPIN) issued by ESFA
- Ofsted unique reference number (URN)
