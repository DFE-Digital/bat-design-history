We added a section to the footer called ‘Get help’ to make it easy for users to find out how to contact the DfE.

The get help information includes:

- the heading - ‘Get help’
- a subheading - ‘Email’
- an email address for the user to contact us
- content telling the user how long we will take to respond

We included the ‘Email’ subheading because we may implement other forms of communication, such as via telephone or online chat, in the future.
