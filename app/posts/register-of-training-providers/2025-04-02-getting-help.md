We added a section to the footer called 'Get help' to make it easy for users to find out how to contact the DfE.

## Why we did this

Users need a clear and consistent way to get support when they encounter problems or have questions about using the service.

By placing help information in the footer, it's available on every page without cluttering the main content. This follows the [GOV.UK Design System footer pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/footer/).

## How it works

The get help section appears in the footer on every page of the service.

The get help information includes:

- the heading - 'Get help'
- a subheading - 'Email'
- an email address for the user to contact us
- content telling the user how long we will take to respond

We included the 'Email' subheading because we may implement other forms of communication, such as via telephone or online chat, in the future.

### Response time

We tell users they can expect a response within 5 working days. This sets clear expectations and aligns with DfE service standards.

## Further considerations

We considered some changes that we did not implement. These included:

- adding a telephone number for urgent queries
- adding links to guidance documentation
- implementing an online chat feature

We will review feedback from users to determine if additional support channels are needed.
