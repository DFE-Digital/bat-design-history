We are often asked whether the Register of training providers (Register) is a transactional service. In this post, we explain why it is not, using GOV.UK guidance on service classification. We also describe what the Register is - a source of truth, a shared record, and a foundation for other services.

## What counts as a transactional service on GOV.UK

According to GOV.UK guidance, a service is transactional if it allows users to either:

- exchange information, money, permission, goods or services
- submit personal information that results in a change to a government record

Services are measured in terms of completed transactions.

Examples of transactional services include:

- Apply for a driving licence
- Pay your self-assessment tax bill
- Apply for a student loan

These services share certain traits:

- A clear start and end point
- A user who needs to do something
- A government decision or outcome
- A measurable transaction (submit, apply, pay, register)

## What the Register does instead

The Register of training providers does not involve a user completing a transaction with government. It is:

- a canonical list of teacher training providers
- a shared record used by multiple services, teams and users
- a structured dataset with accurate, up-to-date provider information

No single user ‘completes’ an interaction with the Register in a linear way. Instead, users view, update or use information in the Register for other purposes:

- policy and compliance teams use the data to regulate accreditation
- service teams use the data to power course publishing and application journeys
- providers check and manage their details over time, but not as a single task

In that sense, the Register is not a transactional service. It is more like:

- a data and information service
- an administrative interface for managing structured records
- a reference point for other transactional services, like Publish teacher training courses, Apply for teacher training or Register trainee teachers

## Why this distinction matters

Understanding that the Register is not a transactional service has shaped our approach in several ways:

- Design and navigation: We do not expect users to complete a single journey. Instead, we support discovery, updating and collaboration over time.

- Service scope and measures: We do not measure success by the number of transactions completed, but rather by data quality, ease of use, and uptake by other services.

- Service ownership: The Register serves internal and external users across several touchpoints. It is part of a wider service ecosystem, not a standalone end-user journey.

## What we considered

We examined closely whether specific actions in the Register could be considered transactions. For example, updating provider details or requesting a change to accreditation. But:

- these actions do not result in an immediate outcome for the user
- many changes go through internal workflows, approvals or reviews
- providers and DfE users interact with the Register repeatedly, not in one-off sessions

This confirmed our position that the Register supports, but does not itself deliver, transactional outcomes.

## Conclusion

The Register of training providers is not a transactional service. It is a shared record, data source and coordination point for other services. By recognising this, we can design more effectively for the real users and relationships involved.
