We recently [updated the ‘Add address’ flow to include a postcode address finder](/register-of-training-providers/adding-an-address-using-a-postcode-address-finder/). We added the postcode address finder to the ‘Add provider’ flow for consistency.

## How it works

Adding an address is at the end of the [‘Add provider’ flow](/register-of-training-providers/adding-providers-to-the-register/).

[![Find address flow](add-provider--find-address-flow.png "Find address flow (select image to see a larger version)")](add-provider--find-address-flow.png)

We use a ‘search and select’ journey to help users quickly find an address.

If users cannot find the address they’re looking for, they can manually enter it.

You can read more about how the journey works in the post [Adding an address using a postcode address finder](/register-of-training-providers/adding-an-address-using-a-postcode-address-finder/).
