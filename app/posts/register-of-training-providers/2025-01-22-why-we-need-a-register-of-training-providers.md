Currently, training provider details are maintained separately by each of the Becoming a teacher (BAT) services, including:

- Publish teacher training courses
- Find teacher training courses
- Apply for teacher training
- Manage teacher training applications
- Register trainee teachers

Each service holds a version of provider data, which can lead to inconsistencies and errors whenever information is copied or updated in one system but not another.

A central ‘Register of training providers’ will serve as the single source of truth for provider data. It will ensure:

1. **Data is consistent and accurate** – When all services draw from the same up-to-date record, differences in provider names, addresses, or statuses are eliminated. This reduces the risk of mismatched data appearing across the BAT services.

2. **Providers update their details only once** – Training providers benefit by maintaining their core details in a single place. This reduces the administrative burden of repeatedly supplying the same information to different parts of the service line.

3. **DfE can track and manage provider information more effectively** – The department gains a clear and consolidated view of all providers. This is critical for decision-making, reporting, funding, and ensuring compliance with regulations.

4. **Reduced risk of errors and data duplication** – Each service can consume the same authoritative provider record. As a result, any updates—such as new accreditation status or contact information—flow out to all the relevant services automatically rather than needing to be duplicated.

5. **A better user experience** – Candidates, trainees, and schools will see consistent training provider details regardless of which BAT service they use. This consistency helps build trust in the system’s reliability and reduces confusion.
