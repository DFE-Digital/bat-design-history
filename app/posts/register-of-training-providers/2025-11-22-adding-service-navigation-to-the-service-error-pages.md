Following the rebrand of the GOV.UK and the changes to the [GOV.UK header component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/), we needed to update the service error pages.

We added the service navigation to the error pages to correctly display the service name and navigation, where appropriate.

The pages affected include:

- page not found - this is known as a 404 page
- there’s a problem with the service - this is known as a 500 page or internal server error page
- the service is unavailable - this is known as a 503 page or a shutter page
- users are not authorised to access the service
- users are not linked to an organisation in the service
- users are not recognised
