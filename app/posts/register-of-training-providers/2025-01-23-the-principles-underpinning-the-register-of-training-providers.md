The ‘Register of training providers’ addresses common data challenges faced by the Department for Education (DfE) and the Becoming a teacher (BAT) service line.

DfE services often require access to accurate and up-to-date data on training providers. However, teams frequently encounter issues such as:

- difficulty sourcing data from multiple sources, leading to inefficiencies
- outdated or inconsistent data that we cannot fully trust
- the need to clean and standardise data before services can use it effectively

## Centralised and structured data

The register will combine structured, reliable datasets on teacher training providers in one place. This centralisation enables service teams and stakeholders to access and use accurate information quickly and easily.

The register will allow users to browse and search for training providers by key attributes, such as location, accreditation status, and provider type. It will also ensure that all relevant organisations, including the DfE, training providers, and other stakeholders, work from a single source of truth.

## Up-to-date and accessible data

We will keep all data within the register current and accessible via a standard application programming interface (API). Service teams integrating with the API will automatically receive updates as data changes, eliminating the need for manual checks and periodic updates.

For those who prefer a manual approach, the latest dataset will also be available for offline use in comma-separated values (CSV) and open document spreadsheet (ODS) formats.

## Clean, high-quality data

The register will ensure that data is complete, accurate, and standardised. Strict guidelines will be put in place to maintain data quality, including:

- avoiding duplicates and inconsistencies
- ensuring the use of standardised naming conventions
- following government data formatting standards

The register reduces the burden on service teams by maintaining high-quality data, allowing them to focus on delivering better services rather than cleaning and verifying data.
