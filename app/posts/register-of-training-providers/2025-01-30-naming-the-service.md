Choosing the right name for a service is essential to its success.

A clear, well-researched name helps users:

- find the service easily through search engines or GOV.UK navigation
- understand what the service does at a glance
- decide quickly whether the service is relevant to them

It also helps internal teams describe and promote the service consistently.

## What makes a good service name

The [GOV.UK service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service) sets out clear principles for naming services. Good names:

- use the words users use
- are based on evidence from analytics and user research
- describe a task, not a technology
- avoid references to policy, legislation, or organisational structure
- are verbs, not nouns
- do not include government department or agency names
- are not brand-led or focused on marketing

These principles help ensure names are clear, resilient to change, and focused on what the user needs to do.

## Why we chose ‘Register of training providers’

While the ‘verbs not nouns’ rule is a helpful default, it is not always appropriate, especially for services that provide structured data or official records. In some cases, a noun-based name:

- aligns better with user mental models
- reflects a well-understood concept (for example, ‘register’, ‘licence’, or ‘certificate’)
- is more accurate for services that support rather than complete a transaction

‘Register of training providers’ refers to a maintained list of organisations that provide initial teacher training (ITT) in England. The word ‘register’ signals that the service is:

- authoritative and kept up to date
- intended for public or professional reference
- structured and trustworthy

It also aligns with how other registers are named across government, such as the [Register of licensed sponsors](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-workers) or the [Register of charities](https://www.gov.uk/find-charity-information).

Importantly, we are not registering providers through this service. That process happens elsewhere. This service is the register itself, a reliable record of accredited ITT providers and their training partners.

## How we will check the name is working

We will monitor how the service name performs by:

- checking search analytics to see how users are finding the service
- listening to the terms users use when they describe the service in research
- reviewing how users link this service to related services such as Publish teacher training courses and Apply for teacher training
- watching for confusion with other government services or registers
- evaluating how third parties (for example, support teams, providers, and policy colleagues) refer to the service

If we see persistent misunderstanding or discover that users are struggling to find or recognise the service, we will revisit the name. Naming is not a one-off decision, it should be reviewed as the service evolves and as we learn more about how people use it.
