We updated the ‘Edit location’ and ‘Remove location’ journeys to be more consistent with Publish teacher training courses (Publish).

## What we changed

We have:

- updated the edit location flow
- introduced a confirmation step for removing a location

## How it works

### Location details

On the location details page, we show a summary list of the location’s details, including:

- name
- location code
- unique reference number (URN)
- address

Users can change the location’s name, URN and address. They cannot change the location code as this is generated by the service.

This page also includes a ‘Remove location’ link, allowing users to remove the location from the organisation.

### Editing a location

Selecting ‘Change’ next to any location details takes the user to the edit location form, where they can edit the location name, URN and address.

### Removing a location

We introduced the ability to remove a location from the organisation.

When someone clicks ‘Remove location’, they must confirm the removal.

If the location is attached to a course, they cannot remove the location before first removing it from the course.
