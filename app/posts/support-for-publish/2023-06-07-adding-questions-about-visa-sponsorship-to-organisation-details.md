Previously, we did some work to [add questions about visa sponsorship to courses](/publish-teacher-training-courses/adding-questions-about-visa-sponsorship-to-courses/)

## Types of visa available to candidates

Depending on a candidate’s circumstances and the course they are applying for, organisations may be able to sponsor a:

- Student visa
- Skilled Worker visa

The Student visa:

- is available only for fee-paying courses
- can only be sponsored by the accredited provider ratifying the course

The Skilled Worker visa:

- is available only for salaried courses
- can be sponsored by the school where the candidate would be working or by the local authority or multi-academy trust that the school operates under


## What we changed

We have added questions about visa sponsorship to the organisation details page

## How it works

### Organisation details page

On the organisation details page, we show a section called ‘Visa sponsorship’. Within this section, we show a summary list containing two items:

- Student visas
- Skilled worker visas

If the support team or organisation has answered the questions, we show the answer and include a change link. There are 2 possible answers:

- Yes - can sponsor
- No - cannot sponsor

Answers to these questions are used in the organisation’s or their training partners’ courses.

If the Support team or organisation has not answered the Student visas question, we show a message and link to:

> Select if this organisation can sponsor Student visas

If the Support team or organisation has not answered the Skilled Worker visas question, we show a message and link to:

> Select if this organisation can sponsor Skilled Worker visas

### Student visas question page

On the Student visas question page, we ask, ‘Can this organisation sponsor Student visas they or their training partners run?’

The question has 2 options:

- Yes
- No

When a user updates the answer, the change does not impact the courses the organisation or their training partners have already created. For clarity, we show the message:

> Changing the answer will not change visa information for courses this organisation or their training partners have already created.

We do not default the question to a specific answer.

If the user has not answered the question, we show an error message:

> Select if this organisation can sponsor Student visas they or their training partners run

### Skilled Worker visas question page

On the Skilled Worker visas question page, we ask, ‘Can this organisation sponsor Skilled Worker visas for courses they run?’

The question has 2 options:

- Yes
- No

When a user updates the answer, the change does not impact the courses the organisation has already created. For clarity, we show the message:

> Changing the answer will not change visa information for courses this organisation has already created.

We do not default the question to a specific answer.

If the user has not answered the question, we show an error message:

> Select if this organisation can sponsor Skilled Worker visas for courses they run
