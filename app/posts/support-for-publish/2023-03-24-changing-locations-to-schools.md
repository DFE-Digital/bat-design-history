We recently updated Publish teacher training courses (Publish) and Find postgraduate teacher training (Find), changing ‘locations’ to ‘schools’. We wanted to reflect this change on the support website.

## What we changed

We have changed the:

- sub-navigation within a provider page
- call to actions in the add single, add multiple and edit locations flows
- table and summary list headings
- add and edit forms in the add single, add multiple and edit locations flows
- success and error messages
