## Data reporting

DfE needs a data reporting service to help share data between School Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITTs), Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), and the DfE.

We aren't currently sharing data, so we don't have the complete picture and can't intervene when help is needed.

**How might we** create a data reporting service so stakeholders can report complete placement data using standardised and easily accessible platforms?

## Mentor availability

Providers need high-quality mentors for their ITT trainees.

They struggle to find mentors within their networks, limiting how many trainees they can recruit.

**How might we** support providers to find enough mentors to maximise trainee capacity?

## Placement challenges

Providers need efficient and high-quality placements in schools for trainees.

Placement challenges exist because some providers have difficulty filling school placement capacity with suitable trainees, whereas others have difficulty placing trainees because of a lack of school placement capacity.

**How might we** make sure providers can place all of their trainees with appropriate placement schools?

## Standardisation

Schools need standardisation in Initial Teacher Training (ITT) processes and mentor training to maintain partnerships with multiple ITT providers, access a broader pool of trainees, and ensure mentors' continuity even after relocation.

The lack of standardisation in ITT curriculum and processes hinders schools from maintaining partnerships with multiple ITT providers, limiting their access to a broader pool of trainees. Additionally, the absence of standardised mentor training and qualification criteria makes it challenging for mentors to continue their roles when they relocate. This inconsistency also affects schools' ability to ensure a consistent pool of qualified mentors.

**How might we** establish a standardised ITT curriculum, mentor training, and foster collaboration between schools and ITT providers to address these issues effectively?
