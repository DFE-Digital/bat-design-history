In previous experiments, we focused on:

- schools adding school placements
- schools managing mentors
- ITT providers finding school placements

Throughout these experiments, it became apparent that it was important for us to explore how we collect and show school and mentor special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) capabilities.

This is because we need to support trainees who:

- are studying a course with a SEND specialism
- need additional help because they may have a disability

## Experiment goals

The experiment had 2 goals:

- general fact-finding about school placements and mentors
- understanding how a school might collect and show SEND capabilities

### General fact-finding about school placements and mentors

The fact-finding part of the research included:

- a general discussion about the participant’s role, their organisation and their ITT provider relationships
- a run-through of their pain points, core needs and any specific challenges they face with school placements and mentors

### Understanding how a school might collect and show SEND capabilities

We showed participants a prototype journey of how a school could collect and show school and mentor SEND capabilities to support trainees who:

- are studying a course with a SEND specialism
- need support because they may have a disability

## Mentor information

![Image showing the flow diagram for editing mentors](experiment-6-edit-mentor-flow.png 'Editing mentors flow')

### Mentor details

![Image showing mentor details](experiment-6-view-mentor--details.png 'Mentor details page')

The mentor details page is split into 2 sections:

- basic details
- additional details

#### Basic details

The basic details section is the information about the mentors added when registered.

The information includes:

- first name
- last name
- teacher reference number (TRN)
- email address
- subject
- age range
- key stage

#### Additional details

The information includes:

- date qualified as a teacher
- qualifications
- date started mentoring
- provider training
- special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) training
- subject networks and associations
- other experiences

### Edit mentor

In this experiment, we added information about:

- special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) training
- subject networks and associations
- other experiences

#### Special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) training

Currently, the SEND training options are based on [Get information about schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) school SEND provision data.

In future, we will update the list to include the types of SEND training teachers can do.

![Image showing the mentor special educational needs and disabilities training question](experiment-6-edit-mentor--SEND.png 'Mentor special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) training question')

The list of SEND training includes:

- Autistic Spectrum Disorder
- Hearing impairment
- Moderate learning difficulty
- Multi-sensory impairment
- Physical disabilities
- Profound and multiple learning difficulty
- Sever learning difficulty
- Social, emotional and mental health
- Specific learning difficulty
- Speech, language and communication
- Visual impairment
- Other difficulty or disability

If the user selects ‘Other difficulty or disability’, we show a free text field so they can give details.

We also include a ‘None’ option.

If the user has not answered the question, we show an error message:

> Select at least one SEND training or select ‘None’

#### Subject networks and associations

This question allows users to add information, including if the mentor works as part of an exam board, if the mentor is working with a subject network in their area, and more. This allows the ITT provider to understand more about the mentor when setting up new school placements.

![Image showing the mentor subject networks and associations question](experiment-6-edit-mentor--networks-and-associations.png 'Mentor subject networks and associations question')

We show a text area for the user to add information about the mentor’s subject networks and associations.

If the user has not answered the question, we show an error message:

> Enter details about subject networks and associations

If the user cannot answer the question, they can select ‘Cancel’ or return to the previous page.

#### Other experiences

This question allows users to add information about a mentor’s vocational experience. This allows the ITT provider to understand more about the mentor when setting up new school placements.

![Image showing the mentor other experiences question](experiment-6-edit-mentor--other-experiences.png 'Mentor other experiences question')

We show a text area for the user to add information about the mentor’s other experiences.

If the user has not answered the question, we show an error message:

> Enter details about other experiences

If the user cannot answer the question, they can select ‘Cancel’ or return to the previous page.

## Organisation information

### Organisation details

Organisation details is a summary of information from on [Get information about schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/).

![Image showing organisation details](experiment-6-view-organisation--details.png 'Organisation details page')

For schools, the organisation details page is split into 5 sections:

- basic details
- additional details
- special educational needs and disabilities (SEND)
- Ofsted
- contact details

#### Basic details

Basic details include:

- organisation name
- UK provider reference number (UKPRN)
- unique reference number (URN)

#### Additional details

Additional details include:

- group
- type
- phase
- gender
- minimum age
- maximum age
- sixth form
- religious character
- admissions policy
- urban or rural
- school capacity
- total number of pupils
- total number of boys
- total number of girls
- percentage of free school meals

#### Special educational needs and disabilities (SEND)

SEND details include:

- special classes
- SEND provision
- training with disabilities

#### Ofsted

Ofsted details include:

- rating
- last inspection date
#### Contact details

Contact details include:

- email address
- telephone number
- website
- address

### Edit organisation

In this experiment, we added information about:

- special classes
- special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) provision
- training with disabilities

#### Special classes

The special classes question is based on [Get information about schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) data.

We allow users to update the information in case GIAS data is incorrect.

![Image showing the organisation special classes question](experiment-6-edit-organisation--special-classes.png 'Organisation special classes question')

The options include:

- Has special classes
- No special classes

If the user has not answered the question, we show an error message:

> Select if the school has special classes

If the user cannot answer the question, they can select ‘Cancel’ or return to the previous page.

#### Special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) provision

The SEND provision question is based on [Get information about schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) data.

We allow users to update the information in case GIAS data is incorrect.

![Image showing the organisation special educational needs and disabilities provision question](experiment-6-edit-organisation--SEND.png 'Organisation special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) provision question')

The list of SEND provision include:

- Autistic Spectrum Disorder
- Hearing impairment
- Moderate learning difficulty
- Multi-sensory impairment
- Physical disabilities
- Profound and multiple learning difficulty
- Sever learning difficulty
- Social, emotional and mental health
- Specific learning difficulty
- Speech, language and communication
- Visual impairment
- Other difficulty or disability

If the user selects ‘Other difficulty or disability’, we show a free text field so they can give details.

We also include a ‘None’ option.

If the user has not answered the question, we show an error message:

> Select at least one SEND provision or select ‘None’

If the user cannot answer the question, they can select ‘Cancel’ or return to the previous page.

#### Training with disabilities

The training with disabilities question is based on a question we have in Publish teacher training courses (Publish) and which is displayed on the course details pages on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

The purpose of the question is for schools to describe how they support training with disabilities. For example, they could use it to describe the accessibility of their facilities, what equipment might be available for people with access needs, and more.

![Image showing the organisation training with disabilities question](experiment-6-edit-organisation--training-with-disabilities.png 'Organisation training with disabilities question')

We show a text area for the user to add information about training with disabilities.

If the user has not answered the question, we show an error message:

> Enter details about training with disabilities

If the user cannot answer the question, they can select ‘Cancel’ or return to the previous page.

## Further considerations

We considered some changes that we did not implement. These included:

- finding the mentor’s details using the Database of Qualified Teachers (DQT)
- improving the language used in questions based on GIAS information
- aligning SEND training options for mentors to available training
- giving options for subject networks and associations based on the mentor’s subject

### Finding the mentor’s details using the Database of Qualified Teachers (DQT)

In the add mentor flow, we ask for a mentor’s name, email address and TRN. We can use the name and TRN to look up the mentor details in DQT, so we do not need to duplicate information, for example, the date they qualified as a teacher and their qualifications.

### Improving the language used in questions based on GIAS information

We have a number of questions based on information we import from GIAS, for example ‘Special classes’, ‘Religious character’ and ‘Urban or rural.’ We need to consider if this language is well understood and what we should name things if it is not understood.

### Aligning SEND training options for mentors to available training

In the prototype, we use the school’s SEND provision options in the list of SEND training options for mentors. This is not correct. The list should contain a common set of SEND training options for mentors.

### Giving options for subject networks and associations based on the mentor’s subject

The ‘Subject networks and associations’ question collects answers as free text. This means we need to guide users so they know what to write. A better option may be to provide standard options based on what we know about the mentor’s subject.

## What we found

### Mentors

Mentor qualifications are helpful as they can be used to showcase mentor capabilities.

There is a lack of mentors with specific SEND qualifications.

Where mentors have some form of SEND training, it might have been via local or online seminars. The training is informal with no specific qualification at the end.

### Schools

There isn’t a single definition for a school’s capability to support trainees with additional needs. This is likely because these types of trainees are less common.

‘Training with disabilities’ was ambiguous. A better term might be ‘Training with additional needs.’

We need to differentiate how the school supports students with special educational needs and how they support trainees with disabilities.
