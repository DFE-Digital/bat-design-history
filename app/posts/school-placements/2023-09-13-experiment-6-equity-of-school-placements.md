[Preamble]

## What we did

[Describe the goal(s) of the experiment.]

## Mentor information

![Image showing the flow diagram for editing mentors](experiment-6-edit-mentor-flow.png 'Editing mentors flow')

### Mentor details

![Image showing mentor details](experiment-6-view-mentor--details.png 'Mentor details page')

The mentor details page is split into two sections:

- basic details
- additional details

#### Basic details

The basic details section is the information about the mentors added when registered.

The information includes:

- first name
- last name
- teacher reference number (TRN)
- email address
- subject
- age range
- key stage

#### Additional details

The information includes:

- date qualified as a teacher
- qualifications
- date started mentoring
- provider training
- SEND training
- subject networks and associations
- other experiences

### Edit mentor

In this experiment, we added information about:

- special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) training
- subject networks and associations
- other experiences

#### Special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) training

Currently, the SEND training options are based on [Get information about schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) school SEND provision data. In future, we will update the list to include the types of SEND training teachers can do.

![Image showing the mentor special educational needs and disabilities training question](experiment-6-edit-mentor--SEND.png 'Mentor special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) training question')

The list of SEND training includes:

- Autistic Spectrum Disorder
- Hearing impairment
- Moderate learning difficulty
- Multi-sensory impairment
- Physical disabilities
- Profound and multiple learning difficulty
- Sever learning difficulty
- Social, emotional and mental health
- Specific learning difficulty
- Speech, language and communication
- Visual impairment
- Other difficulty or disability

If the user selects ‘Other difficulty or disability’, we show a free text field so they can give details.

We also include a ‘None’ option.

If the user has not answered the question, we show an error message:

> Select at least one SEND training or select ‘None’

#### Subject networks and associations

This question allows users to add information, including if the mentor works as part of an exam board or if the mentor is working with a subject network in their area, etc. This allows the ITT provider to understand more about the mentor when setting up new school placements.

![Image showing the mentor subject networks and associations question](experiment-6-edit-mentor--networks-and-associations.png 'Mentor subject networks and associations question')

We show a text area for the user to add information about the mentor’s subject networks and associations.

If the user has not answered the question, we show an error message:

> Enter details about subject networks and associations

If the user cannot answer the question, they can select ‘Cancel’ or return to the previous page.

#### Other experiences

This question allows users to add information about a mentor’s vocational experience. This allows the ITT provider to understand more about the mentor when setting up new school placements.

![Image showing the mentor other experiences question](experiment-6-edit-mentor--other-experiences.png 'Mentor other experiences question')

We show a text area for the user to add information about the mentor’s other experiences.

If the user has not answered the question, we show an error message:

> Enter details about other experiences

If the user cannot answer the question, they can select ‘Cancel’ or return to the previous page.

## Organisation information

### Organisation details

![Image showing organisation details](experiment-6-view-organisation--details.png 'Organisation details page')


### Edit organisation

In this experiment, we added information about:

- special classes
- special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) provision
- training with disabilities

#### Special classes

The special classes question is based on [Get information about schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) data.

We allow users to update the information in case GIAS data is incorrect.

![Image showing the organisation special classes question](experiment-6-edit-organisation--special-classes.png 'Organisation special classes question')

The options include:

- Has special classes
- No special classes

If the user has not answered the question, we show an error message:

> Select if the school has special classes

If the user cannot answer the question, they can select ‘Cancel’ or return to the previous page.

#### Special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) provision

The SEND provision question is based on [Get information about schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) data.

We allow users to update the information in case GIAS data is incorrect.

![Image showing the organisation special educational needs and disabilities provision question](experiment-6-edit-organisation--SEND.png 'Organisation special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) provision question')

The list of SEND provision include:

- Autistic Spectrum Disorder
- Hearing impairment
- Moderate learning difficulty
- Multi-sensory impairment
- Physical disabilities
- Profound and multiple learning difficulty
- Sever learning difficulty
- Social, emotional and mental health
- Specific learning difficulty
- Speech, language and communication
- Visual impairment
- Other difficulty or disability

If the user selects ‘Other difficulty or disability’, we show a free text field so they can give details.

We also include a ‘None’ option.

If the user has not answered the question, we show an error message:

> Select at least one SEND provision or select ‘None’

If the user cannot answer the question, they can select ‘Cancel’ or return to the previous page.

#### Training with disabilities

The training with disabilities question is based on a question we have in Publish teacher training courses (Publish) and which is displayed on the course details pages on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

The purpose of the question is for schools to describe how they support training with disabilities. For example, they could use it to describe the accessibility of their facilities, what equipment might be available for people with access needs, and more.

![Image showing the organisation training with disabilities question](experiment-6-edit-organisation--training-with-disabilities.png 'Organisation training with disabilities question')

We show a text area for the user to add information about training with disabilities.

If the user has not answered the question, we show an error message:

> Enter details about training with disabilities

If the user cannot answer the question, they can select ‘Cancel’ or return to the previous page.

## Further considerations

Improving the language
- special classes
- SEND provision for organisations

Changing the SEND training options for mentors to be more closely aligned to training available

Making the SEND provision and training questions optional and removing the none option

Giving options for subject networks and associations based on the mentor’s subject

## What we found

The term 'training with additional needs' may be more optimal as terminology as opposed to 'training with disabilities'

Mentor qualifications is very useful as even the lead mentor who manages their mentors may not know everything their colleagues have done (eg NPQ)

There isn't really a definition for schools' capability to supporting trainees with needs, this is likely because it is the exception rather than the norm

There appears to be a gap in mentors having specific SEND qualifications, we heard that some seminars are ran and short informal courses etc

Feedback indiciated we should separate sections within the organisation page for supporting students and supporting trainees with needs
