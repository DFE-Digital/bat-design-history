We spent some time mapping our assumptions to understand better which areas of the school placement problem space we should explore.

Assumptions can be risky if they are not openly considered and can even have costly implications if they prove unfounded or incorrect. This is why assumption mapping is such a critical step.

We asked ourselves a simple question: “What assumptions are we making?”

We collected the assumptions on a Lucid board.

We then discussed each assumption and placed them on a priority matrix with certainty and risk on the axes.

## Our assumptions

We took the high risk, unknown assumptions and collated them into categories:

1. Collection via an alternative service
    - The Register trainee teachers (Register) team could add more fields to their service to get the data we need from schools
2. Data collection from schools
    - Schools will share the ‘missing data’ with us
    - If we mandate that schools submit data, we will not have to collect any from providers to fill any gaps
    - There are penalties for not providing the data if the service is mandatory
    - Inferred assumption: it is okay if we do not get data from all schools
    - Financial incentive is enough for schools to want to share their mentor data
    - The biggest risk is that our service is not comprehensive enough to get significant uptake from schools and providers
3. Financial incentive
    - Paying schools for ITT mentors will improve capacity and retention
4. DfE data use
    - The data that we get for ‘find a mentor’ will be enough data for DfE to satisfy their needs
    - This data will be helpful to DfE
    - The Data will help DfE with future plans and make a more informed decision
    - The data we collect will help DfE spot gaps in ITT provision
    - We will know what to do with this data when we have it
5. MVP requirements
    - We can’t develop an MVP service into beta without a complete data set of all mentor
6. Data collection frequency
    - We need to collect data at limited, periodic windows with this service
7. Service interdependencies
    - Publish teacher training courses (Publish) needs to have an accurate list of school placements from us
    - Register trainee teachers (Register) needs to capture information on all trainee placements from us
    - We need an API, for example, to interact with other BAT services and software vendors
