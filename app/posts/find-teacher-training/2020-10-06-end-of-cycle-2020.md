We only show courses that are starting in the upcoming academic year. [Like last year](/find-teacher-training/end-of-cycle-notice/), we need to inform candidates about the courses available as different deadlines in the recruitment cycle approach or are reached.

- **Approaching the end of the recruitment cycle**. Most courses will be closed to new applications or only have a few vacancies left. There is a short window left to apply.

- **18 September 2020**. Applications are closed. Courses can still be searched and viewed, but only to support candidates who have been offered a different course by a provider.

- **3 October 2020**. The 2020 cycle has finished. Find is closed, and no courses are available.

- **6 October 2020**. Find reopens for the new cycle. Courses can be searched and viewed, but applications can not yet be submitted.

- **13 October 2020**. Applications can be submitted.

Ideally we would show messages relating to these deadlines on the service’s [GOV.UK start page](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses), but GDS is too busy to update it for us. Given this situation, we show an interstitial page instead.
