        We found that users were likely to notice and respond to the disclaimer. When questioned, users had a better understanding of what this disclaimer means.

        This page performed significantly better than the [original banner](/find-teacher-training/user-research-apr-25#search-results).

        Some users did not realise they needed to ‘pick one’, the radio buttons and copy were not sufficient in indicating this. We saw users sometimes select multiple radio buttons, first clicking “By location” and then “By provider”, before continuing.

        We [iterated this design](/find-teacher-training/iteration-may-15) to be more explicit about the task and the need to pick only one.
