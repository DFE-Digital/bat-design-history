description: We added content about relocation payments to the international candidates section

We needed to add some information for candidates following the introduction of relocation payments for international students. Depending on the subject, candidates may be eligible for a payment of £10,000 from the UK government to help with the financial costs of moving to England.

## What we changed

We added the following content to the ‘International candidates’ section.

> You may be entitled to £10,000 from the UK government to help with the financial costs of moving to England. Learn more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/non-uk-teachers/train-to-teach-in-england-as-an-international-student">training to teach in England as an international student</a>.

Since the payment is only available for specific subjects, we only show this content if the subject is:

- Ancient Greek
- Ancient Hebrew
- French
- German
- Italian
- Japanese
- Latin
- Mandarin
- Modern languages (other)
- Russian
- Spanish
- Physics
- Engineers teach physics

## Future considerations

We may change the link out from the new content to a more specific page about relocation payments in the future.
