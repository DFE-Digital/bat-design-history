We needed to add some information for candidates following the introduction of relocation payments for international students. Depending on the subject, candidates may be eligible for a payment of £10,000 from the UK government to help with the financial costs of moving to England.

## What we changed

We added the following content to the ‘International candidates’ section.

> You may be entitled to £10,000 from the UK government to help with the financial costs of moving to England. Learn more about [training to teach in England as an international student](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/non-uk-teachers/train-to-teach-in-england-as-an-international-student).

Since the payment is only available for specific subjects, we only show this content if the subject is:

- Ancient Greek
- Ancient Hebrew
- French
- German
- Italian
- Japanese
- Latin
- Mandarin
- Modern languages (other)
- Russian
- Spanish
- Physics
- Engineers teach physics

## Future considerations

We may change the link from the new content to a more specific page about relocation payments.
