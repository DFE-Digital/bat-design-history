There were several content inaccuracies in Find postgraduate teacher training (Find). This meant we needed to update:

- the content above the list of school placements
- the wording on the provider search page

## What we changed

### School placements

In Apply for teacher training courses (Apply) candidates were able to choose a school placement from a list of placements as part of the application process. The Apply team removed this feature because candidates could have the impression that they get to choose where they will be placed.

While some providers might take candidates’ choices into consideration, we know from research that other factors, such as vacancies and suitability, influence where a candidate might be placed.

We changed the wording above the school placements list to remove mention of candidates being able to select a preferred placement when they apply. We changed the content to:

> We work with the following schools to provide your school placements.

### Provider search

If a candidate searches for a school placement in the ‘By school, university or other provider’ field, they may not return any results. This is because school placements are not included in the search – the search includes providers only.

To avoid any confusion, we changed the radio option label to:

> By university or other training provider

We also removed the hint text and updated the text input label to avoid repetition.

## Further considerations

Following the changes to Apply, we need to review the ‘Advice from Get Into Teaching’ sections to make sure the content is still accurate and reflects the candidates’ experience.
