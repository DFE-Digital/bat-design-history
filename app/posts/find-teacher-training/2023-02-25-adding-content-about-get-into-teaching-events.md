The Get Into Teaching marketing team were looking at additional ways to promote teacher training events. We have a link to the events page from the courses search results page in Find postgraduate teacher training (Find), but the team wanted to see if more could be done to explain what events involve and further promote them.

## What we changed

We added some content about what teaching training events are on the ‘Find courses by location or by training provider’ page below the ‘Continue’ button. We also included a link to the events page with a UTM code.

We updated the existing events link from the search results page to include its own unique UTM code.

## Future considerations

The Get Into Teaching team will monitor the success of the links and let us know if any further changes are needed.
