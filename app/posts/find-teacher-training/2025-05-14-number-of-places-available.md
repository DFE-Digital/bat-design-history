We developed designs to display to candidates the number of places of a course. However, following user research we decided not to go ahead with these designs.

## The issue

We had heard in previous research that candidates would like to know how many places are available for each course. They felt that this would help them decide which courses to apply to.

As a department DfE also wanted insight into the capacity of the initial teacher training (ITT) market, to help guide policy decisions.

## What we tested

We developed designs and tested these as part of the [user research with candidates on improving the course content](/find-teacher-training/structuring-couse-content-user-research-with-candidates/).

There was mixed opinion from candidates about whether this would be useful for them when deciding which courses to apply for. Some said it would be helpful, but others said they wouldnâ€™t use it and in fact it would make them anxious about what their chances of success might be.

## Next steps

Based on the feedback from user research we decided not to take these designs forward.
