    - text: Prompt
      caption: The feedback prompt sits just above the footer. Unlike the component used on GOV.​UK, the background is grey to lessen its prominence.
    - text: Feedback form
      caption: If a user selects ‘No’, a feedback form is revealed. This asks for a free text response, and allows users to provide an email address to contact them with, too.
    - text: Report a problem form
      caption: If a user selects ‘There is something wrong with this page’, a separate form is revealed that allows them to send us a message.
    - text: Report a problem form (with validation)
    - text: Success message
      caption: If a user selects ‘Yes’, or submits either form, we replace the prompt with a success message.
    - text: Forms (no JavaScript)
      caption: If the user does not have JavaScript enabled, or the script fails to run, show both forms instead.
    - text: Success message (no JavaScript)
      caption: Upon submitting either form, the user is taken to a thank-you page, which includes a link back to the page they came from.

We currently ask users for feedback, or to report any problems, in the final two paragraphs of a course detail page:

![Existing content shown on course pages.](/find-teacher-training/feedback-component/existing-content.png)

To ensure we gather feedback consistently, we will use [the same feedback component](/apply-for-teacher-training/feedback-component/) used on the Apply for teacher training (Apply) service instead. Using this component means we can also ask for feedback on search result pages, too.
