One of the priorities for the initial teacher training (ITT) reforms is to make ITT less complex for providers, candidates and trainees.

We improved how we show course funding information to make it easier for candidates to understand.

## What we changed

We have replaced the ‘Financial support’ section with ‘Fee or salary’ on the courses list and course details pages.

For each course, we show 1 of 3 options:

- Fee - no salary
- Salary
- Teaching apprenticeship - with salary

If the course is funded through fees, we show additional information:

- Bursaries and student finance are available if you’re eligible
- Scholarships or bursaries, as well as student finance, are available if you’re eligible
- Student finance if you’re eligible

## Further considerations

The content in the ‘Advice from Get Into Teaching’ in the ‘Salary’ section on the course details page is not very informative. We will look at ways to make this content more useful for candidates.
