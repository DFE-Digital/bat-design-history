## The issue

We identified several areas for improvement to the course summary, which is located on the search results page and course page.

### Course fee

We previously merged the row which indicated whether a course was fee-based or salaried with the course fee row, in order to reduce the amount of information on the page.

However, this made it difficult to clearly communicate salaried courses

### Age range

We had several ways of formatting age range and age group across the service.

This formatting didn't match how this information is communicated in Get Into Teaching.

### Qualification

Research found that some users think qualification means the qualifications they need in order to be eligible for the course.

## What we changed

We reverted back to using ‘Fee or salary’ for the row label. This made it clearer when courses paid a salary.

To maximise consistency with [Get Into Teaching](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/), we renamed "Age range" to "Age group" and updated the order of information.

We updated the qualification label to "Qualification awarded".

### Fee based

### Salaried

## Usability testing

This was tested with 18 participants over 2 rounds of testing in July and November 2024.

The findings validated that these changes would be useful to candidates.
