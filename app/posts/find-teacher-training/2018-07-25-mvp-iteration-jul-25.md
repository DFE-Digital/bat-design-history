        Rather than listing alphabetically, group subjects by categories.

        ### Results

        Users found and searched for the subjects they wanted.

        Participant 2 questioned the modern languages group, “[it’s not clear if modern languages is primary or secondary or both](https://lookback.io/watch/QCBC3KYjNxtEuQH5R?t=15m21s)”

        As expected, some of the subject names weren’t clear. For example: “[I’m not sure what Social science means](https://lookback.io/watch/QCBC3KYjNxtEuQH5R?t=16m22s)”

Improvements to the [minimum viable service](/find-teacher-training/all-courses-minimum) include:

- separating and classifying UCAS course subjects
- tweaked distance copy in search results
- added ‘address’ to location field in results
- removed the sort by controls above search results
- changed ‘at’ to ‘with’ in search results
- highlighted course website on course details view
- changed schools you can apply to, to ‘places’
