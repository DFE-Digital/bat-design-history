We were missing some opportunities to link to advice pages on Get Into Teaching from Find postgraduate teacher training (Find). To make sure candidates can easily access more information about teacher training, we added and updated links to Get Into Teaching. We also improved the content.

## What we changed

We added and updated links to the Get Into Teaching website from:

- ‘Support and advice’
- ‘Financial support from the government’
- ‘Where you will train’
- the footer

### Support and advice

We updated the content to emphasise contacting a teacher training adviser, should a candidate need further help and support. The paragraph about ways to train was removed as it detracted from the central call to action - contacting a teacher training advisor.

We changed the 'teacher training adviser' link from the [Get an adviser start page](https://adviser-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/) to the [teacher training advisers](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/teacher-training-advisers) page on Get Into Teaching. We made this change to be consistent with other links out from Find - linking to Get Into Teaching rather than a GOV.UK page. Users can easily access more resources from this page.

### Financial support from the government

As well as bursaries, scholarships and student loans, more financial support is available from the government, for example, a Childcare Grant. To make sure candidates are aware of all the financial support available, we’ve added a link at the bottom of the ‘Financial support from the government’ section for non-salaried courses to the [funding and support](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-support) page on Get Into Teaching.

### Where you will train

We added a link to the [teacher training](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/train-to-be-a-teacher/initial-teacher-training) page on Get Into Teaching from the ‘Where you will train’ section on Find. Candidates have told us they can struggle to understand the difference between providers, and this page gives an overview of the different initial teacher training (ITT) options.

### The footer

Candidates may want to be able to find out more general information about getting into teaching before they search for a course. We added a link to the homepage of the Get Into Teaching website from the footer on Find so candidates can easily access more information.

## Further considerations

We are reviewing the Find start page to see how we can improve the content and link to the most relevant pages on Get Into Teaching.

The content in the 'Financial support from the government' section for salaried courses needs to be improved. Currently, we say that no other financial support is available. However, the government may offer financial support depending on the candidates' needs. For example, Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA) is paid in addition to a salary, should the candidate be eligible.
