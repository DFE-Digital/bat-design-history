## The issue

The information on financial support from the government was presented as paragraphs of text.

This can make it difficult for candidates to easily understand key information and compare it with other courses.

Information specific to non-UK citizens was difficult to find at the bottom of the box.

Information for salaried courses also mentioned salary pay scales in addition to financial support.

## What we changed

### Removed the caption

We removed the caption 'Advice from Get Into Teaching', as it didn't feel necessary to highlight the separation of digital products in the service.

### Separated information

We separated the information for UK and non-UK citizens, and collapsing the information so that the sections are closed by default.

We used a new pattern for how we display information for non-UK citizens, so that it is easy for these users to recognise where information is located that is relevant to them.

#### Fee-based courses

#### Salaried courses

### Reduced and reformatted the content

We reduced the content and added headings to make it clearer what financial support was available for each course.

### Merged salary and fee sections

We merged the 'Salary' and 'Fees and financial support' sections on salaried courses, to make the information clearer and more relevant.

## Usability testing

This was tested with 18 participants over 2 rounds of testing in July and November 2024.

The findings validated that these changes would be useful to candidates, including non-UK citizens.
