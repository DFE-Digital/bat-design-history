## Context

Previous usability studies in January 2025 on [improving the ability to browse and search for courses](/find-teacher-training/improving-the-ability-to-browse-and-search-for-courses-round-1-user-research/) revealed challenges with filtering and sorting on [Find teacher training courses](https://find-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/), especially on mobile.

## Pain points

Issues included:

- seeing the ability to filter on mobile
- difficulty applying or clearing filters
- difficulty knowing what filters are selected
- confusion around terminology

This research aimed to validate new design changes addressing these pain points.

## Research objectives

1. To understand candidates' previous experience of searching for a teacher training course.
2. To observe how candidates navigate the new filtering and sorting designs.
3. To identify if the new designs are effective and helpful for candidates.

## Research participants

10 teacher training candidates:

- 6 domestic, 4 international
- 8 mobile users, 2 desktop users
- 2 users had accessibility needs (dyslexia and requirement for a larger font)

## Methodology

We conducted semi-structured remote interviews with participants via video call.

Each session lasted approximately one hour and included the following activities:

### 1. Prototype interaction
Observed participants as they explored the prototype, focusing on new filtering and sorting designs.
### 2. Feedback collection
Captured participants’ perceptions and usability feedback on the redesigned filter and sorting features.
### 3. Targeted feature testing
Asked participants to complete tasks using specific filtering functions to assess clarity, efficiency, and overall usability.

## What we tested

We [researched filters across government](/find-teacher-training/researching-filters-across-government/) and did design work to [improve how candidates can filter and sort courses](/find-teacher-training/improving-filtering-and-sorting/) on Find.

The designs we tested included:

- updating the content, style and position of the link to open the filter panel
- updating the behaviour of how the filter panel opens
- adding active filters and a link to clear all filters
- moving the location radius filter, training provider search, and sort by feature into the filters
- Updating the content, style, and location of the Get Into Teaching callout box
- adding a dynamic page title showing the search location

## What we iterated

We iterated on the designs during the round of research, based on user insights or team discussion.

### Filter background colour
When [researching filters across government](/find-teacher-training/researching-filters-across-government/) we found filters on either a grey or white background. We wanted to test on both, to see if this made any difference.

### Link to Get Into Teaching and page title

Participants weren't seeing the ‘How to choose a course’ link.

We made the link more prominent by moving it above the page title and styling it in a Get Into Teaching callout box.

We also moved the page title into the search box, to reduce the amount of content needed.

### Filter panel title

We updated the filter panel title from ‘Filter courses’ to ‘Filter results’, as we felt this was more accurate.

## Summary of insights

### Strengths

- Adding, changing, and removing filters felt easy and intuitive
- Seeing active filters was highly valued
- Most-used criteria: location, subject (and age group), funding type, start date, and visa sponsorship
- Overall workflow met expectations with a little to no learning curve
- The designs helped participants find suitable courses quickly and effectively

### Minor feedback

- Requests for additional filters
- Requests for clearer explanations for filters like qualification, training provider, and funding type
- Some participants found a large number of filter options overwhelming

### Pain points

- Understanding specific filters and terminology used, need for more context
- Placement & visibility of the apply filter button, only having it at the bottom of the list of filters
- Zero-results count is discouraging for candidates and may lead to users dropping off from the service

## Research recommendations

- Add contextual help where relevant
- Ensure filters are grouped logically
- Provide alternatives when zero results occurs
- Consider ways to make active filters more prominent
- Consider ways to reduce overwhelm of the number of filters
- Monitor usage of the 'Apply filters’ button
- Monitor usage of the 'How to choose a course' link
