## The issue

Currently candidates need to answer several questions in order to get to a list of relevant search results.

The current journey adds friction and inhibits the ability to give recommendations.

It has become a lengthly process. Research has shown that candidates feel like they are doing their application already, and that it feels like they are making an committment which can be offputting.

We also want the ability to be able to deep link to particular courses from places like Get Into Teaching or Apply for teacher training courses. The current user journey doesn't allow for this.

After [improving the ability to browse courses](/find-teacher-training/improving-the-ability-to-browse-courses/), we wanted to improve how candidates can search for courses by subject and location.

## What we changed

### Replaced question pages with search

We replace the five question pages with a search on the homepage, which allows candidates to search by subject, location, or both.

This allows candidates to search for courses without having to make a decision on location.

It's now just one click from the homepage to view courses on the search results page.

We also [added filters for teaching stages](/find-teacher-training/add-filters-for-teaching-stages/) to allow candidates to further narrow down their search directly on the search results page, without having to go back to the homepage.

## Usability testing

This was tested with 18 participants over 2 rounds of testing in July and November 2024.

The findings validated that this new journey to search for courses would be useful to candidates, and would reduce the friction to finding courses.

## Next steps

We will be tracking the usage of this search and using this information alongside other research to information further design iterations.

We will continue to explore and test the advanced search feature before we build a solution.

We will also be collaborating with the Get Into Teaching and Apply for teaching training teams on utilising the new opportunity to deep link to courses from their services.
