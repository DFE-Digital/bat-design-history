# Goals of the research

The research aimed to test the user journey on Find using the new designs for the homepage, filters, and course page. This was the second round of research looking at these designs.

# Who we spoke to

We spoke to 8 prospective ITT candidates (6 international, and 2 domestic).  

# Methodology

We performed usability testing to understand how participants search for courses relevant to them. In the first half of the session, they were asked to search for courses which were relevant to them and show us how they might narrow down their choices. In the second half of the session, we asked follow-up questions to further understand their thoughts and behaviours. We iterated the designs between interviews based on initial findings.  

# Limitations

**Sample** – The sample was smaller than planned due to drop-out. We planned on speaking to 12 prospective ITT candidates (8 international and 4 domestic), however in total we spoke to 8 (6 international, and 2 domestic).

**Technical Limitations** – The testing involved using a prototype in which some features were not functionable and occasionally required the researcher to guide the participant.

**Limited scope** – The sessions focused primarily on the Find homepage and filters so did not provide a comprehensive view of the entire user journey.

# Key Insights

## Homepage

#### Search Box

Participants were unclear what to enter the 'Keywords' field.
We iterated the designs to change the field label to 'subject'. This was understood by participants, including those interested in primary

#### Advanced filters

The advanced filters were not used by participants for various reasons were mentioned:

* They did not need to refine their search any further than they already had.
* They wanted search broadly first and would use the filters to refine later if needed.
* Some did not notice that it was an option.

### Homepage recommendations

* We recommend that the new homepage designs are implemented, with the search box labelled as ‘subject’.
* Given that the advanced filters were not used by participants, and that they are not needed to implement the new homepage, we recommend that further testing is conducted to decide whether they should be included.

## Primary specialisms

Multiple participants were looking for primary specialisms and were unable to find them. We iterated to add the primary specialism page from the ‘Browse primary courses’ quick link on the home page. This made the primary journey consistent with the secondary journey.

There was also no ability to filter by primary specialisms. Some participants searching for primary were confused by the 'Subject' filter. We therefore iterated the filters replaced the 'Age group' filter with individual 'Primary', 'Secondary' and 'Further education' filters.

### Primary specialisms Recommendations

We recommend that the primary specialisms page is added, and the new filter designs are implemented.

## Filtering results

#### Mobile filters

In the previous research round, participants did not see the filter button on mobile devices. In this round, we tested making the button in a new location and made it 'sticky', so that it stayed at the top of the page even when scrolling. This did not solve the issue, and candidates still could not find the button.

The designs were iterated during the test round - the content was changed, and the text was made bold. The filter and ‘sort-by’ button were also moved onto the same row as each other, meaning that the button was closer to the search results. Following this change, participants were able to find the filter button on mobile.

#### Degree filter

The degree filter did not have a way to unselect all options when a participant is unsure on the degree grade that will achieve (e.g., if they haven't finished their studies). The filter was iterated, and the new version was understood by participants.

#### Qualifications filter

Multiple participants from this round and previous rounds thought 'Qualifications' meant the qualifications they need to get into the course, rather than what they will achieve on completion of the course. The title of the filter was updated to 'Qualification awarded'.

#### Start date filter

A start date filter was added for testing, following feedback from TTAs that it would be useful to some user groups. The participants were confused by the 'another date' response option. We updated the content to 'all other dates'. This was better understood, however there was still some confusion about whether this meant courses in another year.

### Filter Recommendations

* We recommend further design and research looking at the ‘filter’ and ‘sort-by’ buttons on mobile.  Whilst the designs tested meant participants noticed the buttons, there is still work needed to get the buttons ready for implementation.
* We recommend that the new version of the ‘Qualifications awarded’ should be implemented.
* We recommend that further design work and testing is needed on the ‘start date’ and Degree required’ filters to ensure that it is understood by candidates.

## Get into Teaching (GiT) banner

We tested a new banner on the results page, which included links to various GiT pages. Participants found the banner helpful and reported that they would use the links to find out more information about becoming a teacher.

### Get into Teaching (GiT) Banner Recommendations

We recommend adding this banner to the results page.

## Course page content

#### Salaried course callout box

Participants reported it would be useful to have more information about salaried courses, to save them searching online. There is already a Get into Teaching (GiT) page including this information, the designs were iterated to add the link.

#### Fee callout box

Participants understood the information in the callout box, however there was confusion from international participants around how and when the money would be paid.

#### Where you will train

Participants were not satisfied when the location was marked as 'not listed yet'. For some, this would put them off applying to a course.

#### Further information

In the test round, we trialled testing the course page without the ‘about this course’ section. This is due to findings from previous research that the section is not useful to candidates and can often be burdensome due to the unstructured nature. However, we found that candidates felt that there was some information missing on the page, which would be useful to have when deciding. The two main areas include: .

* Information about what the course would be like, how it is delivered, the modules, and the assessments.
* Details about the providers performance, particularly OFSTED ratings.

### Course page recommendations

* We recommend implementing the content tested for the financial support, and salaried courses call-out boxes. This includes the additional link in the salaried call-out box.  
* We recommend the team does further research looking at how they can include more information about how and when international candidates are expected to pay their fees.
* We recommend reviewing the content used when a location is marked as ‘not listed yet’ so that that it gives candidates more information (e.g., they can contact the provider for more information.)
* We recommend that we continue to include the ‘about this course’ section on the course page. We will continue to review and collate findings on the usefulness of this section for candidates.
* We recommend the team continues to investigate ways of including course and provider performance, to help candidates make their decisions.

# Next steps

The design changes we are confident in will be going live in early 2025.
We will also be conducting testing on the following:

* Advanced filters,
* Start date filter,
* Locations marked as ‘not listed yet’,
* About this course section,
* Provider performance.
