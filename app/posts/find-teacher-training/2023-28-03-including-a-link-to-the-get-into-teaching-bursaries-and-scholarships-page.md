The Get Into Teaching team requested that we give candidates a way to access the page about bursaries and scholarships from Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

## What we changed

We added a link to the [bursaries and scholarships page on Get Into Teaching](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries) from the ‘Financial support from the government’ section in Find.

The link will only be displayed if the course has either a bursary or scholarship available.

We also updated the link to the British Council from French, German and Spanish courses to a more specific page about [langauges teacher training scholarships](https://www.britishcouncil.org/education/he-science/opportunities/ltts).
