## Background

We needed to promote the postgraduate teaching apprenticeship (PGTA) more and decided to feature it on the Find homepage. At the time only the [teacher degree apprenticeship (TDA) was featured](/find-teacher-training/improving-the-ability-to-browse-courses/) there.

## What we did

We updated the content in the TDA accordion on the homepage, so that it featured both apprenticeships. We included links to Get into Teaching so that users could find out more about each apprenticeship.

We also needed to provide a link for users to browse apprenticeship courses. There was no easy way to provide separate links to TDA and PGTA courses as that functionality did not exist on Find. So we provided a link to all apprenticeship courses, followed by this sentence:

‘In order to find the right apprenticeship for you, you can filter courses by whether or not you have a degree.’
