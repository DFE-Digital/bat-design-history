We needed to make sure that the dynamic content on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find) was accurate following recent initial teacher training (ITT) policy changes.

## What we changed

The content in the ‘Entry requirements’ section needed to be updated.

### Degree subject

Since it is no longer a requirement that candidates should have a degree in the subject they want to train to teach, we removed the paragraph that stated, “Your degree subject should be in [subject] or a similar subject. Otherwise you’ll need to prove your subject knowledge in some other way.”.

We still show the degree level required and other entry requirements.

### Subject knowledge enhancement (SKE)

For some subjects, candidates may be asked to complete a subject knowledge enhancement course (SKE). These subjects are:

- Biology
- Chemistry
- Computing
- Design and technology
- English
- French
- German
- Mathematics
- Modern languages (other)
- Physics
- Engineers teach physics
- Primary with mathematics
- Religious education
- Spanish

We already included information about SKE in a previous iteration, but we needed to amend the content to make sure it flowed well given the removal of the degree requirement paragraph.

We also changed the conditional logic so that the content is only displayed for the first subject only. For example, if the provider has selected ‘English’ as the first subject in Publish teacher training courses (Publish) and ‘Drama’ as the second subject, the SKE information will be displayed. However, if ‘Drama’ has been selected as the first subject and ‘English’ as the second, the content will not be shown.

### Engineers teach physics

Following the removal of the degree requirements paragraph, we needed to update the content for Engineers teach physics courses to make sure it flowed well. We have retained the content about who the course is designed for, as in this case, candidates with a background in physics will have the opportunity to apply to the providers’ physics course.

We display the SKE content since Engineers teach physics is eligible.

## Future considerations

We will continue to update the ‘Entry requirements’ section in line with any changes in ITT policy.
