On Find postgraduate teacher training (Find), we show all the schools where trainees could be placed during their training for each course. We do not show where they do their theoretical studies.

During recent rounds of research, we found that it was important for candidates to know where they will do the theoretical part of their studies to make a more informed choice about what course to apply for.

## What we changed

We have:

- renamed ‘School placements’ to ‘Training locations’
- added an alphabetical list of ‘Study sites’

## How it works

The training locations section includes:

- advice from Get Into Teaching - if the provider is a higher education institution (HEI) or school centred initial teacher training (SCITT)
- a description of the training - if the provider has added it
- an alphabetical list of study sites
- an alphabetical list of school placements

Both study sites and school placements include the name and address of the location.

## Further considerations

We considered some changes which were not implemented. We could consider them for a future iteration.

### Using study sites in the location search

When a user searches for courses by location, we use the placement school’s address to match against the user’s chosen location.

In a future iteration, we should include study sites in the location matching to make it easier for users to find relevant courses.

### Showing other types of locations

Some providers offer online training as part of a trainee’s theoretical studies. We have not included this in the current iteration as we need to:

- understand the different online or remote training offered by providers
- explore what information candidates need
