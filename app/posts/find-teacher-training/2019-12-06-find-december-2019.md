A complete snapshot of Find postgraduate teacher training as it looked in December 2019.

Changes since [Find’s launch in 2018](/find-teacher-training/live-launch) include:

* A [proper GOV.UK start page](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses)
* A [way of finding courses with a SEND specialism](/find-teacher-training/send-survey)
* A [small map on search results](/find-teacher-training/map-4) showing where a user searched
* A map on course pages showing training locations
* Focus on training location names and address rather than codes (they aren’t needed for UCAS Apply)
* [Better course titles](/find-teacher-training/tweaked-course-titles) in search results and on course pages
* Updated financial incentives
* A filter for finding courses without vacancies (useful towards the end of a cycle)
* Removal of the skills test from course pages and the start page
* No more [minimal course details pages](/find-teacher-training/live-launch#course-not-enriched), all courses have full information

Iteration on Find has been minimal in the last year because the team has needed to focus on an API for UCAS, building Publish, and adding the features needed as the authoritative source of courses (for example ‘Add new course’).
