## The issue

The current process of becoming a trainee teacher is not as seamless as it could be.

This may result in candidates dropping out of the process and not becoming teachers, reduced overall satisfaction with the service, increased volumes of unsuitable applications, and higher levels of provider dissatisfaction.

## Our approach

We reviewed existing user research, previous analysis of pain points, and user needs across multiple services that candidates use on their journey into teacher training. We particularly looked at  [Get Into Teaching (GiT)](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/), [Find teacher training courses (Find)](https://find-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/) and [Apply for teacher training (Apply)](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/).
We wanted to understand how we could ensure candidates have the smoothest possible journey, from the consideration of teaching to accepting an offer (and beyond).

Our assumption was that by improving the journey and better meeting user needs, we could increase conversion and reduce drop out.

## What we found

These were some of the key areas of opportunity we found. Some areas were identified in past research but are still valid in the current cycle.

### 1. Joining up the fragmented candidate journey

The candidate journey is not linear – candidates hop between our services and provider websites, sometimes for several years. This causes many problems, including:

* **Information overwhelm** - Candidates are not sure which websites to look at when, and they're not sure which sites have information they can trust.

* **Getting lost between services** - Candidates can't find what they're looking for or how to return to a service they were on previously.

* **Jarring look and feel** The journey between services feels jarring as the websites have a very different look and feel.

* **Candidates end up on inappropriate services for their point in their journey** - For example, if they end up on Find before exploring GiT they won't have enough information to decode the course options. If they end up on Apply first, they might apply too early and be rejected simply because they did not have the right information.

**How we might solve for this:**

We know from user research that these areas are very frustrating for users, but we need to explore this further. Up till now we have mainly looked at user needs and pain points within services, not across the whole candidate journey.

Before starting to investigate solutions to these problems, more work should be done to look at the impact they are having on candidates.

### 2. Surfacing the right information at the right time

We surface the same information to all users and require them to sift through it to find what's relevant to them. The teacher training process is complex, so some users really struggle with this.

Candidates also have different informational needs at different stages of their journey. For example, early in the journey, detailed information about bursaries and scholarships can feel overwhelming, but candidates need this in-depth information later when they're choosing which courses to apply to.

Research has shown that candidates find it difficult to find relevant information at the time they need it, and that they have wished they knew certain information earlier or later in the process.

**How we might solve for this:**

If we had some information about our users – for example, where they are in their journey, if they are a UK or non-UK citizen, or which routes they are eligible for based on their qualifications – we could surface relevant and tailored information for them.

We could gather this information through candidate accounts, and therefore having accounts across all our services would help significantly with these problems. See the [Research on candidate accounts](/find-teacher-training/exploring-candidate-accounts/) design history for more information on this.

### 3. Surfacing getting school experience

Some candidates are unaware of the ability to [get school experience](https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/), or they find it daunting and would like help from DfE.

> In the 2024/2025 recruitment cycle, there is a statistically significant improvement in both interview rate and offer rate for domestic candidates with school-based references.
>
> <p class="govuk-hint">However, it is hard to determine whether this is correlation or causation, as there are multiple factors at play when providers make the decision to interview and offer.</p>

**How we might solve for this:**

Better surface the Get school experience service to candidates on GiT, Find and Apply. We could also do this through email comms, including tailored comms after rejection.

Expand provision to make it easier to get school experience and explore how we might better support candidates when signing up.

### 4. Help with qualifications and equivalencies

Candidates can find it hard to know they’re eligible for a course, as they find it challenging to understand and prove their equivalent qualifications, particularly international candidates and career changers.

> In the 2024/2025 recruitment cycle, over 40% of rejected applications were due to qualifications, the highest reason for rejection. It was also the highest reason for rejection in the previous recruitment cycle.

**How we might solve for this:**

Adding flight checks when candidates apply for a course that requires a higher grade than the one they have.

Integrate with other services, such as the [Get a replacement exam certificate](https://www.gov.uk/replacement-exam-certificate) service and the [UK ENIC](https://www.enic.org.uk/qualifications/soc) service.

Pilot validating international qualifications or creating an equivalency calculator to suggest equivalencies for certain qualifications.

On rejection due to qualifications, provide tailored course recommendations to reduce the same type of rejection.

### 5. Surfacing Teacher Training Advisers (TTAs)

Some candidates are unaware of TTAs. Candidates who have TTAs are more likely to get accepted onto a teacher training course than those without one.

> 65% of respondents of the TTA exit survey said they would not have been successful at applying without an adviser.

**How we might solve for this:**

More tailored comms to candidates, as well as surfacing and integrating it more into Find and Apply to both raise awareness/sign up and reduce the barrier to entry.

### 6. Support for disabilities

Candidates with disabilities/other needs want information about how teacher training will accommodate and/or support their needs.

**How we might solve for this:**

Improving how providers describe their offering to those with disabilities and other needs on Find.

### 7. Help with routes into teaching

Routes has been one of the most misunderstood aspects of teacher training.

Work has been done in GiT to help candidates [find their route into teaching](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/routes-into-teaching).

However, candidates come to the stage of finding a course with differing levels of knowledge and at different stages in their journey, therefore more could be done to surface the ability to find their route into teaching.

**How we might solve for this:**

Surface the ‘Find your route into teaching’ service on Find and Apply.

Carry the data through from this service into Find, so that candidates have the recommended routes saved as well as the data they have entered about their circumstances.

### 8. Help with comparing providers and courses

Candidates want to learn about the quality of a provider and will research them by looking at their websites. It's sometimes not clear what the role is of Find vs providers' websites.

Candidates want to shortlist and compare courses. Currently they do this by keeping many tabs open in a browser or saving the URLs. It’s hard to return to courses they are interested in or keep track of what has been reviewed already.

The level of content on the course pages can make it difficult to compare, and course information is often very similar.

**How we might solve for this:**

Enable candidates to compare providers as well as courses, and surface provider performance data.

Allow candidates to save courses and search criteria and allow them to group saved information in a way that works best for them.

Mark courses when they have been viewed.

Highlight courses that best suit their skills and experience, and alert candidates when new courses are published that meet their criteria.

### 9. Help with understanding availability

Candidates want to know how many places are left on a course, so they know whether it's worth applying or not and what their chances are.

The was explored in the past, however the team [removed course vacancies](/find-teacher-training/removing-school-placement-vacancies/) as providers often do not know the number of vacancies until late in the cycle.

Candidates are caught by surprise when course availability changes.

**How we might solve for this:**

Utilise Availability Bias to increase the sense of urgency.

Share historical data on past vacancy trends for courses, or estimate vacant places based on number of applications this cycle and the time to last acceptance.

When a shortlisted course becomes full, suggest alternative similar courses in nearby regions or with similar training offerings.

### 10. Help with understanding school placements and course format

Candidates need to clearly understand where they will spend their time during the course, and what the expected course format will be.

This is not always accurate or clear on listings, making it difficult to weigh up the viability of a course, and whether it will be a feasible commitment for them to make.

**How we might solve for this:**

Making it clearer what the course format would be, for example, the minimum time in a classroom setting.

Support providers in giving candidates more structured information on course format, which would be easier to compare.

### 11. Help with applications

Candidates struggle to understand the overall application process and steps to becoming a teacher.

The areas that candidates find the most difficult are personal statement, references and work history (particularly career changers).

> In the 2023/2024 recruitment cycle, personal statement was the second most common reason for rejection (17% of rejections).
>
> In the 2024/2025 recruitment cycle, it is currently the third most common reason for rejection (14% of rejections).

**How we might solve for this:**

Use a [Step by step navigation](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/step-by-step-navigation/) to show the main steps in the process, and bring together the different services a candidate would use.

Simplify the process and provide more guidance around writing a personal statement and adding references and work history, considering integration with services like LinkedIn.

### 12. Improving rejections

Candidates want informative feedback on unsuccessful applications so that they can improve future applications. Provider feedback is important; however, candidates often say they get vague or non-existent feedback. This can feel demoralising.

> In the 2021/2022 recruitment cycle:
>
> * 87% of rejected candidates did not reapply.
> * 45% of candidates who did reapply were successful, which equated to 2,522 additional trainees.
> * 21% of rejected candidates don't receive structured feedback.

**How we might solve for this:**

Encourage or mandate detailed feedback on rejections.

Provide tailored recommendations on next steps after a rejection, such as getting school experience, getting a TTA, trying a different route or trying a different subject.

### 13. Help with the pre-training process

The time between accepting an offer and starting training can be lengthy. Sometimes candidates will withdraw due to changes in personal circumstances, but there may be an opportunity to support and engage candidates during this time to reduce the number of withdrawals.

> In the 2021/2022 recruitment cycle, 12% of candidates who accepted an offer withdrew.
>
> In the 2022/2023 recruitment cycle, 650 candidates withdrew after accepting an offer.

One of the pain points during this phase is the need to enter the same information on multiple services. For example, if a candidate is applying for a scholarship, they must go through another application process with a personal statement and interviews. This can be daunting and off-putting. Many candidates drop out of the scholarship application at the personal questions stage.

**How we might solve for this:**

Provide more detailed information on how scholarships and bursaries work after applying for a course that has financial support available.

Pass Apply data through to the scholarship application service, so that candidates only have to enter the information once.

Review the communication and engagement strategy for candidates during the time from accepting an offer to starting their training.

## Further considerations

We feel the journey from considering teaching to receiving an offer would be greatly improved by focussing on these key areas of opportunity.

Many of these areas require collaboration between multiple teams, such as Get Into Teaching, Publish and Find, and Apply and Manage.

Senior leaders will work with these teams to decide on what areas to focus on, and who will take ownership for different areas.

## Next steps

### Candidate accounts on Find

The team will now explore how introducing candidates accounts on Find might help meet user needs and improve the candidate journey.

This could potentially be expanded to integrate accounts across GiT, Find, and Apply.
