The Find teacher training courses (Find) team wanted to understand how teacher training candidates would react to a candidate account feature being introduced on the service.

An account would enable users to have increased functionality on the service, such as saving courses. This would make it easier for them to browse and compare courses.

This user need had been identified during previous rounds of research.

## Prototype

To undertake the research, a prototype was designed to test several new features. These features included:

- being able to save a course and view their saved courses
- being prompted to sign in or create an account
- navigation between the Find and Apply for teacher training (Apply) service

## Objectives of the research

There were four main objectives:

- to observe how candidates react to the ability to save a course in the Find service
- to observe how candidates navigate from the Find service to the Apply service
- to understand how candidates feel about creating an account on the Find service
- to identify if candidates can utilise the different functionalities of their candidate account within the Find service

## Who we spoke to

We spoke to users from two different cohorts:

- teacher training candidates recruited from the Get into Teaching participant database
- teacher training candidates from the Apply participant database

In total, we recruited 21 participants from an internal database.

16 interviews were completed due to some participants cancelling their interviews or not turning up.

## Methodology

We adopted the following methodology:

One-to-one user testing interviews to observe participants as they navigate the Find prototype to look at training courses.

The interviews were broken down into three parts:

1. We asked participants about their previous experience when searching for a teacher training course.
2. We observed participants using the Find prototype.
3. We asked participants for feedback on the Find service and new candidate accounts features.

## Summary of insights

Five key insights were drawn from this round of research:

1. The candidate account features on the Find service are a welcome change for ITT candidates.
2. Participants in this research feel comfortable creating an account for the Find service, but had some concerns over the friction this would cause when searching for a course quickly.
3. Participants were able to use the account features with little to no prompts and understood their purpose.
4. Participants in this research would utilise the different account features on the saved course page, which enables them to compare courses and receive desired information about their saved courses.
5. Participants’ views on the navigation between the Find service and the Apply service were mixed, but after iterations, it became clear that they were moving into a new service.

## Iterations made during the round of research

We made changes to six prototype elements during the research round, based on user insights.

1. Changes to the navigation to the Apply service from Find

    After interviewing participant 1, the navigation was changed from the Find service to the Apply service. Navigation buttons were added to the “You selected a course” page to allow users to continue their application or cancel and return to the course page.

    Throughout the interview process, iterations were continuously made to the navigation flow to make it clearer to participants that they were moving onto the Apply service once they had clicked Apply for a course. This included text stating, “Continue to the Apply for Teacher Training website in order to apply for this course.”

2. Save the course function added to the results page

    Changes were made to display a save course function on the results page rather than just on the course summary page. This was done by adding a “heart” icon to each of the courses on the results page. Further iterations were made to include the words “save course” next to the heart icon so that it’s clear that this function is. Participants had a positive reaction to being able to save from the results page.

3. Option to filter by saved courses

    The filtering function on the results page underwent iterations to add a filter by saved courses option. However, during testing, participants felt this was unnecessary as there is already a page showing the saved course list. Therefore, this iteration was later removed.

4. Sorting saved courses by location

    On the saved course page, a function lets users sort the list by different factors. Initially, the prototype would let you sort the course by the most recent date added and the course name. Iterations were made to this feature to allow users to sort their courses by the nearest school. Participants received this positively, but they did want clarity on where exactly the proximity is set from.

5. Adding a notes feature to the saved courses page

    After participant 10’s interview, iterations were made to the saved course page to include a notes feature. This feature allows users to add a note to each of their saved courses. Participants' feedback revealed that the notes feature is helpful to users when searching for a course. They would use this feature to note down key pieces of information and have it all stored in one place.

6. Adding nearby courses to a closed course

    An internal decision was made to experiment with adding recommendations to closed courses. This would show the user similar courses that are nearby, underneath a closed course. The feedback was positive, and participants explained that they would find this helpful. For this feature to be effective, the proximity needs to be set to a location desired by the user.

## Next steps

These insights informed the content of a survey, which was designed and shared with over 600 users.

These users all wanted to be involved in a previous round of research and so are invested in the Find service.

We will cross-reference the quantitative feedback from the survey with the qualitative feedback from this round of research to inform the minimum viable product (MVP) design of candidate accounts.

We aim to launch the MVP candidate accounts before October 2025.

We will monitor usage and collect feedback from candidates to help inform future iterations of the candidate account feature throughout the 2025-26 recruitment cycle.
