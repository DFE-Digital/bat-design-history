## The issue

Research found entry requirements were difficult to understand.

The section was located in the middle of the long course pages, and was formatted in paragraphs which took time to understand, which made it difficult to easily compare courses.

## What we changed

We tested a prototype on the week commencing 27 May 2024. The findings allowed us to be confident in some of the changes we could make to improve the page.

We moved ‘Entry requirements’ to the top of the page and improved the formatting.

We converted the information into a [summary list](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/summary-list/), and increased the hierarchy by using [details](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/details/) components to contain information that only some users will need.
