From the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle, all providers will be able to offer salaried courses. We took this opportunity to review the content for salaried courses on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find) to make sure that it is clear.

## What we changed

The ‘Advice from Get Into Teaching’ text box was not very informative. We improved it by:

- adding a link to the [international pay scales for unqualified teachers page](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-pay-scales-for-eligible-teaching-and-education-jobs/national-pay-scales-for-eligible-teaching-and-education-leadership-occupation-codes)

- letting candidates know that salaried courses are in high demand so they should check their eligibility with the provider and apply as soon as possible

## Future considerations

We added a way for users to [filter courses by funding type](find-teacher-training/filtering-courses-by-funding-type/). When we test the filter in user research, we will test the new guidance at the same time.
