When a provider publishes a course, they can list all the schools where a candidate can gain experience. Previously, this list also showed whether there was a vacancy at the school.

The vacancy status was a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and required the provider to keep the course current.

We removed the vacancy status because:

- candidates do not apply to a vacancy at a school
- providers often do not know the number of vacancies at their partner schools until late in the recruitment cycle
- the number of vacancies can change during the recruitment cycle because candidates may need to withdraw
- we are providing false hope that candidates will be placed at certain schools
- providers do not always consider a candidate’s school placement preference on the application, and some don’t know about the preference
- the accuracy of vacancy information depends on providers frequently updating their courses
- Apply for teacher training (Apply) is going to remove the preference for placement schools
