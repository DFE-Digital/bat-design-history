        Users had a tendency to click the first link on the page, in this case ‘school experience’.

        In response we [moved the start button to the top](/find-teacher-training/private-beta/user-research-apr-25#index).

        * * *

        A user expected a link to details about the IETLS exam. [We added a link](/find-teacher-training/private-beta/user-research-apr-25#index).

        Users did not always realise that they needed to choose one option.

        Some users would select ‘by location’, and then select ‘by training provider’ before continuing.

        This might be improved with some content refinements and supporting copy.
    - text: Search by provider

        Users did not always understand the meaning of ‘training provider’

        We [clarified the label](/find-teacher-training/private-beta/user-research-apr-25#search-by-provider) by indicating that it’s a school or university.

      caption: When clicking ‘Only show…’, users did not expect the volume of content that appeared beneath the option.

        Users found it hard to distinguish between search results with similar titles. [We updated search result titles](/find-teacher-training/private-beta/user-research-apr-25#search-results).
