In this round we tested the [private beta as launched](/find-teacher-training/private-beta/private-beta-launch), with one change.

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  hideContents: true,
  items: [{
    text: "Search by location",
    img: { src: "01-search-by-location.png" },
    caption: "Trial a wider default search radius, increasing from 5 to 20 miles.

### Result

Users who did not interact with the radius found and compared more results. While users who expressed a desire to see results within a closer area were seen to switch to 5 miles."
  }]
}) }}
