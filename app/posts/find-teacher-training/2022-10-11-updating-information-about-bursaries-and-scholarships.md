Candidates applying for teacher training courses in England may be eligible for a bursary or scholarship.

Bursaries and scholarships are tax-free amounts of money candidates receive to train in certain subjects. They do not need to pay them back.

Postgraduate teaching bursaries and scholarships are only available for specific subjects. For the 2023 to 2024 academic cycle, these include:

- biology
- chemistry
- computing
- design and technology
- English
- geography
- languages (including modern and ancient languages)
- maths
- physics

Candidates cannot receive both a teaching bursary and a scholarship. They must also be eligible for student finance to receive a bursary or scholarship (unless they’re training to teach physics or languages).

Candidates cannot receive a scholarship or bursary if their teacher training course is salaried.

## What we changed

We have updated the bursary and scholarship information displayed on the:

- list of secondary subjects a candidate can choose when searching for a course
- ‘Financial support’ summary for each course in the results list
- ‘Fees and financial support’ section of a course description

We have also added ‘British Council’ as a provider of scholarships for French, German and Spanish.
