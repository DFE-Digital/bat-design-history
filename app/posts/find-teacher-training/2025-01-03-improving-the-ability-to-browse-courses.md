## The issue

Currently candidates need to answer several questions in order to get to a list of relevant search results.

The current journey adds friction, restricts browsing, and inhibits the ability to give recommendations.

![flow diagram of the current steps involved in the user journey from the homepage to the search results](find-journey-current-jan-2025.png)

It had become a lengthly process, and is a barrier for some candidates. For example, some do not have a specific location in mind.

Research has shown that candidates feel like they are doing their application already, and that it feels like they are making an committment which can be offputting.

We also want the ability to be able to deep link to particular courses from places like Get Into Teaching or Apply for teacher training courses. The current user journey doesn't allow for this.

## What we changed

### Primary and secondary quick links

We updated the primary and secondary course pages, and added new quick links to those pages from the homepage.

This allows candidates to search for courses without having to make a decision on location.

We added grouping to the secondary subjects. Research found that this improved the browsing experience for candidates, as it allowed them to more easily see the subjects most relevant to them.

### Alternative browsing accordion

We added an accordion with specific routes and teaching stages that candidates may be looking for.

These include Teacher Degree Apprenticeships (TDA), courses with SEND specialisms, and teaching other stages such as further education.

This allows candidates to quickly and easily find these types of courses, without having to enter any further information.

It also gave the ability for us to [add links to Get Into Teaching](/find-teacher-training/add-links-to-get-into-teaching/), as candidiates are likely to require more support and guidance to understand these routes and stages in order know if they are right for them.

### Update degree required filter

In order to enable the link to view TDA courses, we needed to add a new option to the degree requred filter on the search results page.

This is because TDA courses are an undergraduate route, therefore we needed a way to allow no degree to be required.

## Usability testing

This was tested with 18 participants over 2 rounds of testing in July and November 2024.

The findings validated that these routes to search results would be useful to candidates, particularly international candidates.

## Next steps

We will be tracking the usage of these routes and using this information alongside other research to information further design iterations.
