After several iterations and additions to the ‘International candidates’ section, we decided to review the content to ensure it flowed well, and the conditional statements were correct. We also wanted to improve the content about visa sponsorship to make it clearer if visas can be sponsored or not, as we now have this information at a course level.

## What we changed

We made changes to the content and show different information depending on the type of course.

### All courses

The section leads with a reminder that candidates need the right to study in the UK. This information was correct and in the right place for all course types.

We changed the link at the end of the section to take users to a page about [training to teach in England on Get Into Teaching](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/non-uk-teachers/train-to-teach-in-england-as-an-international-student), rather than the [GOV.UK page](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants/train-to-teach-in-england-if-youre-a-non-uk-citizen).

### Apprenticeships

If the course is an apprenticeship, we tell candidates that they must have lived in the UK for at least 3 years before the start of the course.

## Salaried courses

Student visas are not available for courses with a salary. Therefore, we show information about Skilled Worker visas with a link to a GO.UK page. We then say if a Skilled Worker visa is available depending on the answer the provider has entered in Publish teacher training courses (Publish).

If a Skilled Worker visa is not available, we include more information about other types of visas and a link to a GOV.UK page.

## Fee-paying courses

Skilled Worker visas are not available for non-salaried courses. Therefore, we show information about Student visas with a link to a GOV.UK page. We then say if a Student visa is available or not depending on the provider’s answer in Publish.

If a Student visa is not available, we include more information about other types of visas and a link to a GOV.UK page.

## Relocation payments

Depending on the subject, candidates may be eligible for £10,000 from the UK government to help with the financial costs of moving to England.

We show information about relocation payments if the subject is:

- Ancient Greek
- Ancient Hebrew
- French
- German
- Italian
- Japanese
- Latin
- Mandarin
- Modern languages (other)
- Russian
- Spanish
- Physics
- Engineers teach physics

## Further considerations

We will continue to review this section in line with any policy changes.
