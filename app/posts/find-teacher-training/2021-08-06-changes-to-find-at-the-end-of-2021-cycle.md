Candidates applying again in the 2020 to 2021 recruitment cycle can no longer submit an application for courses starting in the 2021 to 2022 academic year.

### 4 October 2021 at midnight

The recruitment cycle ends (candidates can no longer be placed on courses starting in the 2021 to 2022 academic year). We stop showing course listings on Find.

### 12 October 2021 at 9am

Candidates can submit applications for courses starting in the 2022 to 2023 academic year.

## Candidates are informed about upcoming deadlines

A banner starts showing across Find approximately 2 months before the [deadline to apply for the first time](/find-teacher-training/changes-to-find-at-the-end-of-2021-cycle/#7-september-2021-at-6pm):

![Inform candidates about upcoming deadlines.](upcoming-deadlines-notice.png)

[Candidates who start an application before the deadline are also informed about deadlines through Apply](/apply-for-teacher-training/end-of-cycle-2021/#candidates-are-informed-about-their-deadline-to-apply).

## Candidates are informed that the deadline to apply for the first time has passed

After the [deadline to apply for the first time](/find-teacher-training/changes-to-find-at-the-end-of-2021-cycle/#7-september-2021-at-6pm), a new banner replaces the [previous banner](/find-teacher-training/changes-to-find-at-the-end-of-2021-cycle/#candidates-are-informed-about-upcoming-deadlines):

![Inform candidates that the first deadline has passed and the deadline to apply again is approaching.](first-deadline-has-passed.png)

The banner aims to discourage candidates applying for the first time from searching courses on Find. This is because there's no guarantee that the courses shown (those starting in the 2021 to 2022 academic year) will be available the following year.

[Learn what happens on Apply if a candidate starts an application but does not submit by their deadline](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/apply-for-teacher-training/end-of-cycle-2021/#if-a-candidate-does-not-submit-by-their-deadline).

### If a candidate applying for the first time tries to select a course after the deadline

Even after the [deadline to apply for the first time](/find-teacher-training/changes-to-find-at-the-end-of-2021-cycle/#7-september-2021-at-6pm) has passed, it’s still possible for a candidate applying for the first time to click on the ‘Apply for this course’ button on course pages (the [banner message](/find-teacher-training/changes-to-find-at-the-end-of-2021-cycle/#candidates-are-informed-that-the-deadline-to-apply-for-the-first-time-has-passed) may not result in the intended behaviour):

![Candidates applying for the first time can still click on the 'apply' button even after their deadline.](apply-for-this-course-button.png)

The button will not be disabled because candidates applying again are still eligible to choose and apply to the courses shown on Find until 21 September 2021 at 6pm.

To prevent candidates applying for the first time from adding courses starting in the 2021 to 2022 academic year (which they're no longer eligible to apply to) we will not take them through the usual "You selected a course" journey:

![Candidates applying for the first time after the deadline cannot select a course.](select-course-journey.png)

The candidate is instead sent straight to their task list where they’re informed that [courses are closed](/apply-for-teacher-training/end-of-cycle-2021/#if-they-carry-over-before-find-reopens%2C-they-cannot-find-courses) and that [they cannot submit yet](/apply-for-teacher-training/end-of-cycle-2021/#if-they-carry-over-before-apply-reopens%2C-they-cannot-submit).

Candidates applying again after the deadline to apply for the first time will go through the course selection journey as normal.

## Candidates are discouraged from searching for courses after the deadline to apply again has passed

Although candidates cannot submit an application after the [deadline to apply again](/find-teacher-training/changes-to-find-at-the-end-of-2021-cycle/#21-september-2021-at-6pm) pas passed, we continue to show course listings so that providers and candidates who’ve already applied can finalise any post-submission activity (such as making and accepting offers).

A banner lets candidates know that courses are closed but that they can start or continue applying for the next cycle anyway:

![The deadline to apply again has passed.](courses-closed-banner.png)

We also remove the [‘Apply for this course’ button](/find-teacher-training/changes-to-find-at-the-end-of-2021-cycle/#if-a-candidate-applying-for-the-first-time-tries-to-select-a-course-after-the-deadline) after the deadline to apply again because it implies that you're applying for a particular course, when in fact there's no guarantee that the 2021 to 2022 course listings will be available the following cycle.

The following message replaces the button, enabling candidates to start or continue an application despite courses being closed:

![Stop allowing candidates to click 'Apply for this course'.](courses-closed-start-application-anyway.png)

As before, candidates do not go through the ['you selected a course' journey](/find-teacher-training/changes-to-find-at-the-end-of-2021-cycle/select-course-journey.png).

## Candidates can no longer view courses when the recruitment cycle has ended

[When the recruitment cycle ends](/find-teacher-training/changes-to-find-at-the-end-of-2021-cycle/#4-october-2021-at-midnight) candidates can no longer be placed on courses starting in the 2021 to 2022 academic year, so we stop showing the 2021 to 2022 courses.

Anyone trying to visit Find will be informed that courses are closed, but we enable them start or continue an application anyway:

![Course listing are not shown when the recruitment cycle ends.](find-does-not-show-courses-when-the-cycle-has-ended.png)

## Candidates can browse courses when the recruitment cycle begins

When the [recruitment cycle begins](/find-teacher-training/changes-to-find-at-the-end-of-2021-cycle/#5-october-2021-at-9am) candidates can view courses starting in the 2022 to 2023 academic year.

The ‘Apply for this course’ button is reinstated on course pages.

Candidates can add courses to their application but they cannot submit it until [applications open](/find-teacher-training/changes-to-find-at-the-end-of-2021-cycle/#12-october-2021-at-9am).

{% from "govuk/components/inset-text/macro.njk" import govukInsetText %}
{{ govukInsetText({
  text: "On clicking 'Apply for this course', users will no longer be asked whether they want to apply on UCAS as it will no longer be a route to apply for teacher training from October 2021."
}) }}

## Candidates can submit their application when applications open

Candidates can submit applications for courses starting in the 2022 to 2023 academic year when [applications open](/find-teacher-training/changes-to-find-at-the-end-of-2021-cycle/#12-october-2021-at-9am).
