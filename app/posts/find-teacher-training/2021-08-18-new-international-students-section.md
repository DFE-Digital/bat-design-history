We’ve started looking at how to improve the experience for non-UK based candidates applying for postgraduate teacher training. As part of this, we reviewed the information on course pages.

As there are a few things that only international students need to know, we’ve added a new section to bring this information together.

The section starts by saying whether that course is able to sponsor visas or not. This text is based on the answer providers give to the [new visa sponsorship questions](/publish-teacher-training-courses/visa-sponsorship/) in the Publish teacher training courses (Publish) service.

The rest of the information is static, and the same for every course.

We plan to iterate and add to this information as we learn more about the needs of international candidates.
