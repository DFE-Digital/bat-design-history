When viewing an ‘Engineers teach physics’ course on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find), we incorrectly show a message stating candidates need a degree in physics.

## What we changed

If a physics course is marked as an ‘Engineers teach physics’, we show the following:

> Your degree subject should be in engineering, material science or a related subject. Otherwise, you’ll need to prove your subject knowledge in some other way.
>
> If your degree is not in engineering or a related subject, please apply to our physics course.
