## The issue

We knew from previous research that candidates found the large blocks of dense text on Find difficult to navigate. They struggled to locate important information needed to compare courses and find the right ones for them.

> It’s a big wall of text.
*Candidate, 2024 user research*

We’d also had similar feedback from some providers about the amount of text on the Find website, and how overwhelming and difficult to digest this could be for candidates.

> It’s quite wordy for applicants. I think they get a bit overwhelmed by the amount of text and just need clear, punchy basic outlines.
*Provider, 2022 user research​*

Here is an example of the long ‘About the course’ section, taken from a real course:

## User research

We carried out [user research with candidates, testing a prototype with re-designed course pages](/find-teacher-training/structuring-couse-content-user-research-with-candidates/).

[The designs that we tested.](/find-teacher-training/structuring-course-content-design-with-candidates/#screenshots)

## What we tested

### Reducing the length of each section

We wanted to avoid large chunks of text, as we knew candidates found these hard to digest. So we shortened the length of each section on the course page.

### Adding ‘Why train with us’

We knew from previous research that candidates struggled to differentiate between courses and providers. Why should they choose one rather than the other? So we introduced a section called ‘Why train with us?’.

![screenshot of one of the new Why train with us section.](why-train-with-us.png)

Candidates found this section useful when it included provider background and links, but most felt it lacked specific, differentiating details needed to make informed comparisons.

We addressed the need for providers to add for specific information about what makes them different, rather than a generic sales pitch, in our new designs for the Publish teacher training service.

### Removing ‘About the course’ and adding ‘What you will do on school placements’ and ‘What you will study’

Analysis showed that there was significant overlap in content between the 'Where you will train’ and ‘About us’ sections. Specifically, information about what trainees would do in their placement schools, and how they would be mentored or supported, could be in either section.

![screenshot of the anaylsis of the about the course section with different colours indicating different topics, such as information about assessments, mentors, or school placements.](current-about-section-analysis.png "Example of the analysis on the About the course section above. School placements (in red), theoretical learning (in yellow), mentors (blue)")

This made it difficult for candidates to easily compare information between courses.

The three sections on the prototype – ‘Where you will train’, ‘What you will do on school placements’ and ‘What you will study’ – all tested well. Participants understood where to find the information they were looking for, and did not find the amount of content overwhelming.

Again, several participants commented that the information was too general and not specific enough to that particular provider. As before, we tried to address this with the prompts we gave providers in the new designs for Publish.

### Adding links to Get Into Teaching

We knew from previous research that Find users can be at very different stages of their journey into teacher training. Many of them are at an early stage, and often do not yet know much about teacher training, the routes available, or how to choose a course.

This information is on [Get Into Teaching](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/), rather than Find. So we included lots of links to Get Into Teaching throughout the course pages to make it easy for candidates to access information that would help them choose the right course for them.

This tested well with participants:

> I like that it links you to more information. The Get into Teaching page helps answer some key questions that is missing from the information on the prototype.

### Accordions vs contents list

We tested two page designs with candidates. One design had a contents list which the user could use to navigate to the different sections of the page. In the other design each section of the page was in an accordion which could be opened up.

![screenshot of the two versions of the protoype that was tested.](a-b-testing.png)

Opinion was mixed during our research, but generally participants preferred the non-accordion version. However, this may have been because most candidates we tested with were using a laptop. Accordions may make the page easier to navigate on a mobile – this is possibly something to consider in future user research.

Read more about this in the [design history on our user research with candidates](/find-teacher-training/structuring-couse-content-user-research-with-candidates/).

## What we did not test

We did not test a table layout for school placement information.

We originally thought that we might put school placement information in a table to make it easier for candidates to compare between courses. For example, the length and location of each placement, and what they will do in each school.

However, when we analysed the content that providers had written for existing courses there was too much variety between courses to have consistent table fields.

## Next steps

We decided to go ahead with all the designs that we tested (except the accordion navigation). These are scheduled to go live in September 2025 ahead of the start of the new recruitment cycle.

We took on board the feedback that candidates need specific information from providers, and used this to inform a redesign of Publish. We developed a prototype for the Publish service and then carried out [user research with providers](/publish-teacher-training-courses/user-research-with-provider-on-redesigns-to-course-content/).
