## Context

Candidates found large blocks of dense text difficult to navigate and struggled to locate key information needed to assess and compare courses.

The Find team redesigned the course pages to better meet the needs of ITT candidates by restructuring long-form content and improving usability.

## What we tested

We introduced three new content sections by splitting up the current “About the course” section:

- Why train with us
- Where you will train
- What you will do on school placements

We added clearer information on online interview availability and introduced an online interview filter.

We developed two prototype versions with different contents list layouts to test navigation preferences between hidden and non-hidden text.

## Objectives

During this round of research we had three primary objectives:

- to assess whether the design changes made to the long-form course content on the course page are beneficial for ITT candidates
- to observe how ITT candidates interact with the designs on the Find prototype when comparing teacher training courses
- to identify which structure of the Find prototype design is preferred by ITT candidates (accordion or non-accordion version)

## Who we spoke to

Initial Teacher Training candidates from the UK who are the beginning of their teacher training journey – searching for a teacher training course or applying for a teacher training course. This also includes career changers.

## Methodology

We conducted 1-1 usability testing interviews via Microsoft Teams using a prototype of the Find service which was created to mimic the experience that candidates will have when searching and viewing courses.

The prototype presented participants with 2 sets of courses to view and examine the content.

Participants were observed whilst using the Find prototype to identify how they engage with the course summary content and what information they are looking for.

The participant list was split so that half the participants examined the non-accordion version of the prototype first, and the other half examined the accordion version of the prototype.

## Summary of insights

There were six main areas of feedback from candidates:

### Clarity and structure of course summaries

Participants appreciated the clarity, structure, and navigability of the course summary pages, valued detailed and specific content (especially about providers, placements, and finances).

They suggested improvements for more personalized, less generic information and better comparison features.

Participants need specific information so they can see if the course and provider have the key characterises they are looking for.

### Preference for non-accordion layout

Most participants preferred the non-accordion version of the prototype that displayed the contents lists with hyperlinks or expandable sections, allowing direct access to specific information.

### Challenges in comparing courses and providers

Participants were somewhat able to find the information they needed on the Find prototype, especially regarding key course features, funding, and the interview process.

However, it was not clear what the key differences were between different courses and providers, or what the strengths and drawbacks of each programme were.

Participants wanted to know which course would be best for their career prospects and why there were so many options if they were all similar.

### Need for improved course comparison

Participants struggled to compare teacher training courses on the Find prototype – the process is manual and relies on reviewing and contrasting information across individual course pages.

Participants noted that while the information is present, there is no dedicated "comparison table" or side-by-side comparison feature, which would allow for a more direct, at-a-glance comparison of multiple courses.

### Unclear distinctions between courses and providers

Some participants expressed difficulty in understanding the key differences between courses and providers, such as the organisation structure, the nature of the provider (university vs. trust), or the implications for future career opportunities.

### Helpful filters: online interviews valued; degree grade less so

Participants generally found the online interview status and filter helpful, especially for those relocating or needing flexibility. They would find it useful if it was mandatory for courses to display if they offer online interviews. The degree grade filter option is useful to some participants is not necessary.

## Recommendations

The following recommendations were made to the team to consider taking forward:

### Enhance Course Comparison Tools - Implement a Comparison Table

Participants expressed a strong need for a feature that allows them to compare multiple courses side by side, similar to retail websites.

This could be in the form of a comparison table that allows users to view key pieces of information (entry requirements, placement location, organisation type, funding options etc) from multiple courses in one place.

### Detailed accessibility information needs to be consistently provided in course summaries

There is a clear need for explicit information on accessibility (e.g., wheelchair access, support for disabilities) across all courses.

### Need for more course and provider specific information

Participants found the information in the course summary pages to be too generic. Particularly, the “Why Train with Us” section was utilised in way that provides candidates with sufficient overview of the provider.

There is need for in-depth information that covers the different aspects of training experience that will be provided.

This includes more detail on:

- the content and structure of the course
- background and ethos of the provider
- learning and assessment methods
- potential placement school types and characterises
- location of training
- breakdown of mentor relationship and support available

### In-depth information on placements

Participants reported placement information as being a key factor when comparing teacher training courses.

They felt that the course summary pages lacked specific information on possible placement locations, which meant they couldn’t identify if the course is logistically feasible for them.

There is a need for greater detail about the placement experience including, placement hours, mentor relationship and school types.
