Course descriptions on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find) include a section called ‘International candidates’. This section outlines what international candidates need to be able to undertake the course, such as visa requirements.

Teaching apprenticeships for international candidates have additional requirements that were not included in the section.

## What we changed

We added the following guidance to the ‘International candidates’ section of the course description for teaching apprenticeship courses:

> To apply for this teaching apprenticeship course, you’ll need to have lived in the UK for at least 3 years before the start of the course.
>
> EEA nationals with settled or pre-settled status under the [EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families) who have lived continuously in the EEA, Switzerland, Gibraltar, or the UK for at least the previous 3 years will also be eligible.
