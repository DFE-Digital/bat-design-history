When we had a ‘View on map’ link it wasn’t seen by users, we had to prompt them to open it to see the map.

When we defaulted to the map view users were expecting a list and they didn’t discover the search filters.

In this design we’ve:

- switched the list view back to being the default
- replaced the ‘view on a map’ link with a mini map you can click
- used the mini map to clarify where a user is searching (and improved the copy – eg Within 20 miles of the pin rather than 20 miles around Manchester)
- highlighted the map feature more clearly
- made the map full screen, hiding all other site furniture except a close button
- taken the location filter out of the filters disclosure on mobile, so the map is visible
