Previous analysis showed us that a common reason for rejection is international candidates without the right to work or study in the UK applying for courses that are unable to sponsor visas.

To address this, we’ve [asked providers whether they can sponsor visas](/publish-teacher-training-courses/visa-sponsorship/) and have included this within a [new ‘International students’ section](/find-teacher-training/new-international-students-section/).

However, to save candidates from having to browse courses individually to find ones that will sponsor visas, we’ve also added a checkbox to the filters.

By default, this checkbox is unchecked, and all courses are shown.
