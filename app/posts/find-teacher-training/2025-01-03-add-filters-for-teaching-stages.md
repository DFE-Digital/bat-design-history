## The issue

Currently candidates need to answer several questions in order to get to a list of relevant search results.

If candidates want to make a change to their search, such as change the subject, they need to go through all of the steps again.

Research has shown that candidates want the ability to easily make changes to their search without having to go back to the start.

## What we changed

### Added age group filters

We added new filters for the different stages of teaching, to allow candidates to make changes to their search criteria from the results page.

### Removed further education qualification type

We also removed the qualification type "PGCE or PGDE without QTS". This is because this qualification type was confusing for the majority of candidates who are looking for primary or secondary courses.

This qualification type is only for further education courses.

Now that we have added the new further education filter to make it clearer for those interested in this stage of teaching, we were able to remove this qualification type.

## Usability testing

This was tested with 18 participants over 2 rounds of testing in July and November 2024.

The findings validated that these filters would be useful to candidates.

## Next steps

We will be tracking the usage of these filters and using this information alongside other research to information further design iterations.
