## The issue

Currently candidates need to answer several questions in order to get to a list of relevant search results.

If candidates want to make a change to their search, such as change the subject, they need to go through all of the steps again.

Research has shown that candidates want the ability to easily make changes to their search without having to go back to the start.

This design change has be previously explored:
- [Making the service more browseable](https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/find-teacher-training/making-the-service-more-browseable/) - May 2022
- [Enhancing the browsable Find concept prototype](https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/find-teacher-training/enhancing-the-browsable-find-concept-prototype/) - September 2022
- [Filterable Find postgraduate training courses (Find) concept](https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/find-teacher-training/filterable-find-concept/) - October 2022

## What we changed

We added new filters for the different stages of teaching, to allow candidates to make changes to their search criteria from the results page.

## Usability testing

This was tested with 18 participants over 2 rounds of testing in July and November 2024.

The findings validated that these filters would be useful to candidates.

## Next steps

We will be tracking the usage of these filters and using this information alongside other research to information further design iterations.
