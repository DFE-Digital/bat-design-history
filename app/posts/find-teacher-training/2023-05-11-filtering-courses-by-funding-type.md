We currently have a ‘Salary’ filter that allows candidates to tick a box to ‘Only show courses with a salary’. The policy team identified the need for candidates to see which salaried courses are ‘Teaching apprenticeships’.

We are exploring the idea of allowing candidates to filter more specifically by fee paying courses, salaried courses and salaried teaching apprenticeship courses.

## What we changed

We have replaced the ‘Salary’ filter with a ‘Fee or salary’ filter containing all 3 funding options.

### ‘Salary’ filter

![Salary filter](course-list-filter--salary.png "Filtering the course list by whether the course has a salary")

### ‘Fee or salary’ filter

![Fee or salary filter](course-list-filter--funding-type.png "Filtering the course by funding type: ‘Fee - no salary’, ‘Salary’ or ‘Teaching apprenticeship - with salary’")

## How it works

The ‘Fee or salary’ filter contains:

- Fee - no salary
- Salary
- Teaching apprenticeship - with salary

All options are selected by default.

If the user changes their selection, for example, only selecting ‘Salary’ from the filter, the courses list will only show courses with a salary that meets the other filter criteria.

## Further considerations

We need to test this filter in user research to see if candidates understand what a salaried teaching apprenticeship course is at this stage in their journey to becoming a teacher.

We also considered including a way to filter courses by fee amount. We did not do this because:

- we would need two filters - one for domestic fees and one for international fees
- 81% of domestic fees are in a narrow band between £9,000 and £10,000 and would not be suitable for a filter
- 70% (7,167) of fee paying courses do not include an international fee

We are [improving the international fee data](/publish-teacher-training-courses/making-international-fees-mandatory-for-providers-sponsoring-student-visas/) by making it mandatory for providers to enter the data if they sponsor Student visas.
