We recently added an ‘Engineers teach physics’ question to the ‘Add course’ and edit course flows in Publish postgraduate teacher training (Publish).

## What we changed

We added a filter to the search results page on Find Postgraduate Teacher Training (Find) called ‘Engineers teach physics’. We only show this filter if physics is one of the subjects chosen by the user.

Applying the filter removes all courses that are not marked as ‘Engineers teach physics’ by the provider in Publish.
