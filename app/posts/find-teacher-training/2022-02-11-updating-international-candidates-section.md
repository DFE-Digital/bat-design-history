We previously added an [‘International students’ section](/find-teacher-training/new-international-students-section/) to help candidates from outside the UK get the information they need. This includes letting them know whether visa sponsorship is available for a course.

We have renamed this section ‘International candidates’ because:

- it's more consistent with ‘candidate’, which we use throughout Apply for teacher training
- candidates may apply for a salaried course where the term ‘student’ is less applicable

We have also updated the content to:

- explicitly explain that candidates already have the right to work and study if they have ‘indefinite leave to remain’
- mention other visa types which do not need sponsorship, such as Graduate and Family visas
- link to GOV.UK guidance about [training to teach in England if you’re a non-UK citizen](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants/train-to-teach-in-england-if-youre-a-non-uk-citizen)

We also add the following caveat when indicating that visa sponsorship is available:

> Before you apply for this course, contact us to check [visa type] visa sponsorship is available.

This is because visa sponsorship availability can vary across courses based upon who the accrediting body is (for Student visas) or who the employer is (for Skilled worker visas).

We plan to make some changes to Publish teacher training courses (Publish) so that we can offer candidates more certainty in the future.

We have also added a sub-section titled ‘International qualifications’ which gives more explicit information about statements of comparability from UK ENIC, including that candidates may be able to get this for free.
