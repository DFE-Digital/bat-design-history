In August last year, we [added a new ‘International students’ section](/find-teacher-training/new-international-students-section/) as a place where we could explain things that people applying from outside the UK need to know, including whether the course offered visa sponsorship or not.

We have renamed this section ‘International candidates’ for more consistency with the ‘candidate’ term we use elsewhere, and because users are not students at the point of applying, and may also apply for a salaried course where the term ‘student’ is less applicable.

We have also updated the content to:

* explicitly explain that candidates already have the right to work and study if they have ‘indefinite leave to remain’
* mention other visa types which do not need sponsorship, such as Graduate and Family visas
* link to a guidance page on GOV.UK titled [Train to teach in England if you’re a non-UK citizen](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants/train-to-teach-in-england-if-youre-a-non-uk-citizen) which has more information.


Where the information from Publish indicates that the provider can sponsor the relevant visa for the course (Student or Skilled worker), we have made the guidance less certain:

> Before you apply for this course, contact us to check [visa type] visa sponsorship is available.

This is because visa sponsorship availability is more complicated than we previously believed, and depends upon either who the accrediting body is (for Student visas) or who the employer is (for Skilled worker visas), and therefore the information as collected through Publish may not be accurate.

This is not ideal, and we hope to be able to improve this in future changes to Publish, enabling us to be more certain in the language used.

We have also added a sub-section titled ‘International qualifications’ which gives more explicit information about statements of comparability from UK ENIC, including that candidates may be able to get this for free.
