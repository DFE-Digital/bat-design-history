## The issue

[Get into Teaching](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/) has developed significantly over the last 12 months.

This means there are now missed opportunities where we can link to guidance pages from Find and support candidates who need more information before proceeding to the next step.

## What we changed

We added additional links to Get into Teaching from the homepage, search results page, and courses pages.

### Callout boxes on the homepage

We added two callout boxes on the homepage to direct users to information on how to become a teah, and to contact Get Into Teaching.

### Navigation to TDA courses, SEND courses, and teaching other stages

We added an accordion to the homepage to direct users to search for particular kinds of courses, such as TDA courses, courses with SEND specialisms, or teaching other stages.

These sections also include links to Get Into Teaching to learn more about these particular routes and stages.

## Usability testing

This was tested with 18 participants over 2 rounds of testing in July and November 2024.

The findings validated that these links would be useful to candidates, and that they would give candidates confidence in proceeding to the next step.

## Next steps

We will be tracking the usage of these links and using this information alongside other research to information further design iterations.
