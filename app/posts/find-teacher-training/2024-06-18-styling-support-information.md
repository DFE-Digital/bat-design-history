## The issue

As part of [reducing the length of course pages](/find-teacher-training/improving-course-pages/), we found that information that was the same across all courses was not visually differentiated, such as information on support and advice.

This makes it difficult for candidates to view course information and compare courses.

## What we changed

We tested a protoype on week commencing 27 May 2024. The findings allowed us to be confident in some of the changes we could make to improve the page.

We visually differentiated the support and advice information from information that's specific to the course.
