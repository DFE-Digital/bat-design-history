We updated the service unavailable pages used when:

- a page is not found - this is known as a 404 page
- there’s a problem with the service - this is known as a 500 page or internal server error page
- the service is unavailable - this is known as a 503 page or a shutter page

## How it works

The ‘Page not found’ page tells the user we cannot find the page they were trying to view. We include navigation to allow the user to continue using the service.

The service unavailable pages do not include any elements which require the service to be available. This means that they do not include:

- feedback banner
- breadcrumbs and back links
- chat widget
- footer navigation links

### Page not found

This page includes:

- the page title - ‘Page not found - Find postgraduate teacher training - GOV.UK’
- the heading - ‘Page not found’
- content telling the user to check the web address
- an email address for the user to contact us

### There’s a problem with the service

This page includes:

- the page title - ‘Sorry, there’s a problem with the service - Find postgraduate teacher training - GOV.UK’
- the heading - ‘Sorry, there’s a problem with the service’
- content telling the user to try again later and that any information they’ve entered has not been saved
- an email address for the user to contact us

### The service is unavailable

This page includes:

- the page title - ‘Sorry, the service is unavailable – Find postgraduate teacher training – GOV.UK’
- the heading - ‘Sorry, the service is unavailable’
- content telling the user when the service will be available if we know it, for example, “You’ll be able to use the service from 3pm on Wednesday 2 November 2022.”
- content telling the user to try again later if we do not know when the service will be available - this should not usually be the case for planned maintenance
- content saying that any information the user has entered has not been saved
- an email address for the user to contact us
