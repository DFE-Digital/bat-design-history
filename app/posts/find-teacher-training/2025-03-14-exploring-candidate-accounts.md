## The issue

Currently [Find teacher training courses (Find)](https://find-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/) does not provide the ability for candidates to log in to an account, unlike [Apply for teacher training (Apply)](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/).

We identified issues which may be solved or improved by having candidate accounts on Find.

These issues may result in candidates dropping out of the process and not becoming teachers, a reduction in overall satisfaction with the service, increased volumes of unsuitable applications, and higher levels of provider dissatisfaction.

## Our approach

We reviewed existing user research, previous analysis of pain points, and user needs across multiple services that candidates use on their journey into teacher training.

We explored how certain functionality might help meet user needs and created design concepts to visualise elements of the user journey.

We focussed first on what it might be like to just have candidate accounts on Find, before exploring how the scope might be expanded to potentially join multiple services up under one account.

We wanted to understand how adding candidates accounts on Find would improve the journey for candidates, increase conversion and reduce dropout.

## What we found

The key issues identified were:

1. [Candidates give us the same information in multiple places](/find-teacher-training/exploring-candidate-accounts/#1.-candidates-can’t-save-or-shortlist-courses)
2. [Lack of information at the point of need](/find-teacher-training/exploring-candidate-accounts/#2.-candidates-aren’t-aware-when-courses-they’re-interested-in-become-full-or-close)
3. [Navigating the process between multiple services](/find-teacher-training/exploring-candidate-accounts/#3.-candidates-often-aren’t-clear-on-which-courses-they-might-be-eligible-for)

### 1. Candidates can’t save or shortlist courses

We have consistently heard in user research that users want to shortlist courses of interest and compare potential courses to decide on their best options, but this isn't easy on Find.

Candidates will keep multiple tabs open with the different courses or save the URLs in a note or in their email.

It’s also hard for candidates to return to courses they’re interested in or keep track of what they’ve already viewed.

**How candidate accounts on Find might solve for this:**

Allow candidates to save or bookmark courses. They could also save searches and courses could be marked when viewed.

### 2. Candidates aren’t aware when courses they’re interested in become full or close

Candidates are caught by surprise when course availability changes, and they need a way to get updates if course availability changes.

Candidates are not aware that there are course deadlines and courses fill up on a first come first served basis. This means they can inadvertently miss out. A high proportion of rejections are for this reason, and this is hugely demoralising for candidates who may not apply again.

**How candidate accounts on Find might solve for this:**

If a candidate has saved courses they’re interested in, we could notify them if these courses close. We could also recommend similar courses that they might be interested in, so that a course closing is not a dead end.

### 3. Candidates often aren’t clear on which courses they might be eligible for

The differences between courses and routes are complex, and some users struggle to understand which courses they are eligible for, or to find suitable courses for them.

This results in:

* candidates getting frustrated and dropping out of the process
* candidates applying for courses that aren’t suitable for them and getting rejected

**How candidate accounts on Find might solve for this:**

Candidates could add further information about themselves – for example their qualifications – and we could use this to suggest courses to them. We could also recommended courses based on their saved courses.

Note - this may result in candidates having to provide the same information more than once.

We could also send tailored email nudges for a range of things, such as:

* suggested courses
* relevant important information, e.g. on qualifications, routes or bursaries
* getting a teacher training adviser or getting school experience

We could also surface relevant information based on what we know about the candidate. For example, highlighting relevant information for non-UK citizens.

## Expanding candidate accounts beyond Find

Candidate accounts on Find could be the starting point for significantly better integration between our services.

We identified issues which may be solved or improved if GiT, Find and Apply were connected by one candidate account

We have not investigated this area in detail, so further exploratory work will need to be done. This should look at what problems this would solve, and what potential impact it could have on the candidate experience, conversion and dropout.

The key issues identified were:

### 1. Candidates give us the same information in multiple places

We ask candidates to tell us the same information – such as their name, email address or whether they have a degree – in many different places. As well as being frustrating for candidates, it also adds friction to their journey and may prevent them from taking actions like signing up for a teacher training adviser.

![Map of the pieces of data candidates are asked for, from when they are considering teaching on Get Into Teaching, to when they are applying. The map illustrates the same information is asked for many times o the journey, such as name and email address](5-sharing-data.png)

**How candidate accounts across services might solve for this:**

Have one account across GiT, Get School Experience, Find and Apply, so candidates would only need to enter each piece of information once.

### 2. Lack of information at the point of need

The process of becoming a teacher can be long and overwhelming, with different decisions and information needed at each stage.

Research has shown that candidates find it difficult to find relevant information at the time they need it, and that they have wished they knew certain information earlier or later in the process.

For example, some candidates were not aware they could sign up for a free [teacher training adviser](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/teacher-training-adviser/sign_up/identity), or [get school experience](https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/), and would have liked to know this at the start. On the other hand, some candidates found the amount of detail on [bursaries and scholarships](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries) to be overwhelming and would like to have this information later in the process when they are thinking about applying for funding.

**How candidate accounts across services might solve for this:**

Use candidate data to better serve their needs and tailor the information we give them.

For example, if we know a user hasn’t already got a teacher training adviser but their qualifications make them eligible for one, then we can strongly nudge them towards getting one across GiT, Find and Apply.

If we know a candidate is already applying to courses, we could surface more detailed information about bursaries and scholarships.

We could also use this data to give more tailored recommendations, based on their qualifications, work experience and reasons for rejection or withdrawal from courses.

### 3. Navigating the process between multiple services

The journey from considering teacher training to applying involves multiple different services.

Candidates find it difficult to navigate between services and will often have tabs open with GiT, Find, provider websites and Apply.

Candidates often get lost between services and find it difficult to get back to where they were. They also find the jump between services quite jarring as the look and feel is very different (particularly between GiT and Find).

**How candidate accounts across services might solve for this:**

Having one account across these services would help our services feel more joined up, creating a more seamless experience for candidates.

We feel this will reduce barriers to becoming a teacher, potentially increasing conversion and reducing drop out.

## Next steps

We will develop and test designs for candidate accounts on Find, focusing initially on an MVP of candidates just being able to set up an account and then save courses.

We will develop the MVP in line with these principles:

1. Candidates must be able to easily browse courses without logging in/setting up an account.
2. The initial account setup should be as quick and easy as possible and will allow candidates to save courses.  After that, we will prompt them to input more information bit by bit to offer them increasingly tailored course recommendations.
3. All information entered on Find must transfer over to Apply. This will reduce the burden of applying to courses as many of their details will already be there.
4. The solution must not block further integration with other services.

Senior leaders will decide if/when to take forward candidate accounts across multiple services.
