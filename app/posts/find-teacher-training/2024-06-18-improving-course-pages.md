## The issue

### Previous user research

Previous research conducted in February 2022 found that:

- candidates find the course pages are long and feel overwhelming​.
- course information is often very similar, making it hard for candidates to know which are right for them​

Some commented that they would prefer for the pages to contain only key points, and to be formatted in a way that allows for quick scans, for example with bullet points.

> "It's quite tiring having to read a lot after work / day job, I want something that supports me in doing a quick information scan" - Career Changer

It’s not clear what is the role of Find vs providers’ websites​​, and how they should be using each; and for some candidates it becomes a game of ‘spot the difference’.​

> "I wouldn't use the Gov website as the 'sole course' for researching and getting information. I would likely look at the provider’s website instead." - Career Changer​

Some proposed an accordion structure so that they’re less overwhelmed by the sheer amount of text.​

Most course pages look fairly identical, so candidates look for small differentiating factors that might win them over.​

> "It's all very samey so it’s hard to tell the difference between courses" - Recent Graduate

Course descriptions can be longer than necessary and the usefulness of the information contained in them varies.

> "There's a lot of text in ‘About the course’ - it could be shorter, punchier and to the point more.. i.e. - what you will learn, what you will be doing" - Career Changer

### Further investigation

When the design team did further investigation, we identified the following areas for improvement.

Key information such as entry requirements was difficult to find.

A lot of information was the same across all courses and not visually differentiated, such as information on support and advice.

Information was presented to everyone that may only be relevant to some people, such as information for international candidates or those with disabilities and other needs.

Information was presented to everyone that may only be relevant the first time they view a page, and not when they are trying to compare courses, such as information about the provider and accredited provider.

The list of school placements was sometimes very long.

Information that was specific to the course was long paragraphs of text, rather than more structured or concise information.

## User testing

We tested a protoype on week commencing 27 May 2024.

The findings allowed us to be confident in some of the changes we could make to improve the page.

Navigating the site and finding information was easy:

> "I'd say it was easy, very easy. It's all quite visible and spread out."

Navigating on mobile generally tested well:

> "So I haven't had an issue with scrolling through or to find the information that I need navigating on a mobile."

The website was good for comparing courses, and the accordions were useful:

> "So the website's quite good for comparing them isn't it? Everything being put in the same place. The headings are very easy to follow. Once I've read one, I know how to read them all."

## What we changed

Moved ‘Entry requirements’ to the top of the page and improved the formatting.

Moved information for international candidates to collapsed sections.

Moved information for people with disabilities to a separate page.

Moved the list of school placements to a separate page.

Moved the information about the provider, including their contact details, and about the accredited provider to separate pages.

Visually differentiated information that was not specific to the course, for example support and advice information.

## What we are continuing to test

- Whether it’s helpful to further emphasise information such as the course fee or distance to the nearest school placement
- Whether we can move the paragraphs of information about the course into an accordion, and remove the contents list
- Whether we should remove the list of school placements, as they are not always accurate, and cause confusion for candidates who think they can choose their placement

## Further considerations

Content analysis on the long form course information to find common patterns, to turn commonly entered information into structured data and help candidates more easily compare courses.

Working with providers to better understand their needs and expectations, to allow them to enter more concise information.

Discussion on location to decide how to best present information about school placements to provide the most accurate information to support both candidates and providers.

Discussion on the purpose of Find vs the provider websites, to ensure we have a clear strategy and purpose that supports future iterations.
