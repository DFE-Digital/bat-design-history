## The issue

### Previous user research

Previous research conducted in February 2022 found that:

- candidates find the course pages are long and feel overwhelming.
- course information is often very similar, making it hard for candidates to know which are right for them

Some commented that they would prefer for the pages to contain only key points, and to be formatted in a way that allows for quick scans, for example with bullet points.

> A career changer found the course page to be "quite tiring" to read, particularly while juggling work and other commitments, and wanted something that "supports me" in getting the information quickly.

It’s not clear what is the role of Find vs providers’ websites, and how they should be using each; and for some candidates it becomes a game of ‘spot the difference’.

> A career changer said they wouldn’t use this page as the sole method for researching, and would likely "look at the provider’s website instead."

Some proposed an accordion structure so that they’re less overwhelmed by the sheer amount of text.

Most course pages look fairly identical, so candidates look for small differentiating factors that might win them over.

> A recent graduate found the course pages "very samey" and said it was hard to tell the difference between courses.

Course descriptions can be longer than necessary and the usefulness of the information contained in them varies.

> A career changer said there was a lot of text in "About the course", and suggested it could be "shorter", "punchier" and more to the point.

## What we changed

We reduced the length of the course pages by moving information to be accessible at the point of need.

### Information for non-UK citizens

Information for international candidates was presented to everyone, when it is only relevant to some people.

We moved this information into two collapsed sections.

These sections can be opened by candidates when the information is relevant to them.

### Information for those with disabilities

Information for those with disabilities and other needs was presented to everyone that may only be relevant to some people.

We moved this information to a separate page.

### List of school placements

The list of school placements was sometimes very long.

We moved this list to a separate page.

### Information about the provider and accredited provider

Information about the provider and accredited provider was presented with the course information.

This makes it difficult when trying to compare courses.

We moved this information, including their contact details, to separate pages.

## User testing

We tested a prototype on the week commencing 27 May 2024.

The findings allowed us to be confident in some of the changes we could make to improve the page.

Navigating the site and finding information was easy:

> Participants were able to navigate the page, saying it was very easy, and all "quite visible".

Navigating on mobile generally tested well:

> Participants were able to find the information on a mobile, saying they "haven’t had an issue" with scrolling through.

The website was good for comparing courses, and the accordions were useful:

> Participants were able to compare courses, and liked that everything was in the same place, "headings are very easy to follow", and once they read one they know how to read them all.

## What we are continuing to test

- Whether it’s helpful to further emphasise information such as the course fee or distance to the nearest school placement
- Whether we can move the paragraphs of information about the course into an accordion, and remove the contents list
- Whether we should remove the list of school placements, as they are not always accurate, and cause confusion for candidates who think they can choose their placement

## Further considerations

Content analysis on the long form course information to find common patterns, to turn commonly entered information into structured data and help candidates more easily compare courses.

Working with providers to better understand their needs and expectations, to allow them to enter more concise information.

Discussion on location to decide how to best present information about school placements to provide the most accurate information to support both candidates and providers.

Discussion on the purpose of Find vs the provider websites, to ensure we have a clear strategy and purpose that supports future iterations.
