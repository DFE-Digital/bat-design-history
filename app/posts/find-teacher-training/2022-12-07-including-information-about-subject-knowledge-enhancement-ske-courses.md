Research by the Apply for teacher training (Apply) team found that some candidates lack awareness of subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) courses. Some candidates had never heard of SKE, and some were unsure when and how to enrol.

To make sure candidates have access to information about SKE when searching for courses, we’ve included a link to the Get Into Teaching page from Find postgraduate teacher training (Find).

## What we changed

We changed the content in the ‘Entry requirements’ section on Find and added a link to [the SKE page on Get Into Teaching](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/train-to-be-a-teacher/subject-knowledge-enhancement).

We now include:

> If your degree is not in [subject], or you've not used your subject knowledge in a while, you may be asked to complete a [subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/train-to-be-a-teacher/subject-knowledge-enhancement).

Since SKE is only available for specific subjects, we only show this content if the subject is:

- biology
- chemistry
- computing
- design and technology
- English
- languages
- mathematics
- physics
- religious education

For primary mathematics, we include:

> If you need to improve your primary mathematics knowledge, you may be asked to complete a [subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/train-to-be-a-teacher/subject-knowledge-enhancement).

## Future considerations

During our Publish teacher training courses (Publish) research, some providers told us they would like more control of the content in the entry requirements section. For example, it may be the case that a provider will not be willing to accept a drama graduate who has taken an SKE course in English to become an English teacher.

More research is needed in this area, and we will work with the Apply team to establish if changes need to be made to Publish.
