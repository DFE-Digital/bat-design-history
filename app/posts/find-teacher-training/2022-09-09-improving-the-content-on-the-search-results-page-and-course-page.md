We changed some of the content on the search results page and course page on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find) to make it clearer and more consistent.

## What we changed

We have updated the:

- filter headings
- course listing
- individual course pages

### Filter headings

We changed ‘Study type’ to ‘Full time or part time’. This matches the content in Publish teacher training courses (Publish) and is a more accurate description of the filter.

We replaced brackets with hyphens on some of the options:

- ‘Pass (ordinary degree)’ is now ‘Pass - ordinary degree’
- ‘Full time (12 months)’ is now ‘Full time - 12 months’
- ‘Part time (18 to 24 months)’ is now ‘Part time - 18 to 24 months’
- ‘Modern languages (other)’ is now ‘Modern languages - other’

### Course listing

We removed the full stop from the content next to ‘Degree required’. For example, ‘An undergraduate degree at class 2:2 or above, or equivalent’ - the full stop was unnecessary.

### Course page

We added detail to ‘Age range’ in the summary list at the top of the page by specifying if the course is for primary, secondary or further education. For example, ‘11 to 16 - secondary’.

We changed ‘About this course’ to ‘Course summary’ as it is a more accurate description of that section - it has been noted in user research that the entire course page is about the course. This matches the change we made to the heading for that section in Publish.

We added a new row to the summary list - ‘Academic year’. Adding this information helps candidates applying for finance easily see which academic year the course falls into.

## Further considerations

Following the [new visa sponsorship flows in Publish](/publish-teacher-training-courses/adding-questions-about-visa-sponsorship-to-courses/), we will be able to collect more accurate information on whether a visa can be sponsored for a course. We will look at updating the content in the ‘International students’ section on Find to give candidates a clearer indication if visas can be sponsored or not.
