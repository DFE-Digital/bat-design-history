We changed some of the content on the search results page and course page on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find) to make it clearer and more consistent.

## What we changed

### Filter headings

We changed ‘Study type’ to ‘Full time or part time’. This matches the content in Publish teacher training courses (Publish) and is a more accurate description of the filter.

We changed ‘Degree grade accepted’ to ‘Degree required’ as it matches the search results page summary heading and is more concise.

### Search results page summary

We removed the full stop from the line of content next to ‘Degree required’. For example, ‘An undergraduate degree at class 2:2 or above, or equivalent’ - the full stop was not necessary.

### Course page

We added detail to ‘Age range’ in the summary list at the top of the page by specifying if the course is for primary, secondary or further education. For example, ‘11 to 16 - secondary’.

We changed ‘About this course’ to ‘Course summary’ as it is a more accurate description of that section - it has been noted in user research that the entire course page is about the course. This matches the change we made to the heading for that section in Publish.

## Further considerations

Following the [new visa sponsorship flows in Publish](/publish-teacher-training-courses/adding-questions-about-visa-sponsorship-to-courses/), we will be able to collect more accurate information on whether a visa can be sponsored for a course. We will look at updating the content in the ‘International students’ section on Find to give candidates a clearer indication if visas can be sponsored or not.
