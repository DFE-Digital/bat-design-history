## Goals of the research

The research aimed to test the user journey on Find using the new designs for the homepage, filters, and course page.

The designs aimed to help candidates navigate to a relevant and manageable list of search results.

The research also aimed to test the location content on Find which aimed tomake candidates feel more informed when choosing a course.

## Who we spoke to

We spoke to 9 prospective initial teacher training (ITT) candidates (4 international, and 5 domestic).

## Methodology

We performed usability testing to understand how participants search for courses relevant to them.

In the first half of the session, candidates were asked to search for courses which were relevant to them and to show us how they might narrow down their choices.

In the second half of the session, we asked follow-up questions to further understand their thoughts and behaviours.

We iterated the designs between interviews based on initial findings.

## Limitations

### Technical limitations

The testing used a prototype in which some features were not functionable and occasionally required the researcher to guide the participant.

### Limited scope

The sessions focused primarily on the Find homepage and filters so did not provide a comprehensive view of the entire user journey.  

## Key insights

### Homepage

![screenshot of homepage deisgn](find-homepage-prefiltering-ur-r1.png)

#### Search box

Participants understood to include ‘subjects’ in the ‘Keyword’ field.

They also thought they could include other words such as university name, qualification type and age range.

#### Visa sponsorship

International candidates noticed, and used, the visa sponsorship check box.

#### Browse all courses

International candidates preferred browsing by subject so that they can see what options are available.

In contrast the domestic candidates preferred using the search box as they tended to already know what course they were looking for.  

#### Homepage recommendations

Given that the homepage concept tested well for both domestic and international participants, we recommend that we continue to iterate and test homepage designs.

We recommend that we explore adding advanced filters, and hint text to the ‘keywords’ field.

### Subjects page

When ‘Browse course by subject’ was selected, candidates were shown a refined version of the subjects’ page, where the subjects had been grouped, rather than listed alphabetically.

Candidates preferred the subjects being grouped and could easily find the subject they were looking for. They understood terms such as STEM and humanities​ used in the group headings.

The subjects had also been grouped so that those with bursaries were shown at the top. When looking at this page, candidates did not notice which course had bursaries.

The designs were iterated to revert the style of the bursary content.

### Subjects page recommendations

We recommend using the version of the course page which has the subjects grouped, with the individual bursary information written under each option.

### Results page

#### Change results

The option to change their search on the results page was useful as it helped them to narrow down and expand the number of results.

Participants used the radius to narrow down their search results to a manageable list ​

#### Sort-by

When using the ‘sort-by’ options, participants reported that ‘distance’ was useful whilst ‘newest’ wasn’t relevant.

‘Closing date’ was useful for some, but for others it wasn’t relevant as they would complete the application straight away.

Other suggestions for ‘sort-by’ options included: fees, provider popularity or ranking, course length and start date.  

#### Filters

The filters were easy to use ​and useful when changing or amending a search.

The updated Degree Grade, Subject and Age filters were all understood.

Some participants thought 'Qualifications' meant the qualifications they need to get onto the course, rather than what they will achieve on completion of the course.

Candidates expected the apply filters button to be at the bottom of the list, so the designs were iterated to add it there.  

One candidate also expected applied filter labels to present so that they could see what they had selected.  

Candidates on mobile phones did not notice ‘show filters’ option until it was pointed out.

#### Results page recommendations  

- we recommend that we continue to explore & test ‘sort-by’ options  
- we recommend that we add the updated filters and the ‘apply filters’ button at the bottom of the list
- we recommend that we explore the filters button on mobile devices to ensure it is visible  

### Course page

#### Contents

We initially tested the page without a contents section and found participants were struggling to find information on the page.

The designs were iterated to add a contents section.

The page was also re-ordered so the most important information, such and fees and location, were at the top.  

#### Hyperlinks

 Participants reported they would like links to open in a new tab so that they don’t lose the page which they are on.  

#### ‘About this course’ section

 Participants felt the ‘About this course’ section was unstructured, and they would skip past it when on the page.  

#### Course page recommendations  

- we recommend reordering the page so that the information most important to candidates is at the top  
- we recommend that all hyperlinks open in a new tab
- we recommend that we review the ‘about this course’ section in upcoming research to determine how useful it is, and how we can improve it  

### Location  

#### Results page content

Participants understood what was meant on the results page by ‘placement schools’, ‘study sites’, ‘nearest potential location’ and ‘not listed yet’.

For some, a location was marked as ‘not listed yet’ it might sway them away from choosing that course.

#### ‘Where you will train’ section

When reading the course page content, participants felt like they had no control over their placement.

However, once they read the ‘How placements work’ box, they were reassured.

#### Salaried courses

Salaried course pages referred to both g both ‘placement school’ and ‘employment school’.

This caused confusion, leading candidates to think they were two separate things.

Participants referred to placement schools on salaried courses as ‘employment schools’  

#### Location recommendations  

- we recommend using the tested content as candidates understood it and felt reassured by it
- we recommend changing the content to ‘employing school’ instead of ‘placement school’ for salaried courses. We will test this in future research rounds

## Next steps

The design changes we are confident in will be going live in 2024/ early 2025.
