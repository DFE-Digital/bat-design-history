A follow-up to our original [end of cycle notice](/find-teacher-training/end-of-cycle-notice). Now that nobody can apply to the 2019/2020 cycle we need to disable search until the new cycle opens on 1 October.

It is confusing to allow users to search for courses in the current cycle. Find postgraduate teacher training (Find) returns a small set of courses that have not been filled, this will mislead candidates about their options for 2020/21. It is not clear that results shown are just for 2019/20.
