The ‘Claim funding for mentors’ service will start on the main GOV.UK domain so that it’s easier for users to find.

This will also mean that we’re following the approach set out in the government Service Standard, which says that [all public-facing services must have a starting point on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/get-your-service-on-govuk).

## How it works

The start page tells users:

- the dates the training has to have taken place between for the claim to be valid
- the details they will need to complete a claim
- where they can get extra guidance if they need it

A ‘Start now’ button takes users to the service’s sign-in page.
