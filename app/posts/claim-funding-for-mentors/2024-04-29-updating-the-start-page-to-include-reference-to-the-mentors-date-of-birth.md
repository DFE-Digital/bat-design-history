Previously, we added the mentor’s date of birth to the ‘Add mentor’ flow to improve information security.

We needed to reflect this on the start page so that users know what the service needs.

## What we changed

We added an extra bullet point to the ‘Before you start’ section. The section now states:

> You’ll be asked for:
>
> - initial teacher training (ITT) provider name
> - your mentors’ teacher reference numbers (TRN)
> - your mentors’ dates of birth
> - hours of training each mentor completed
