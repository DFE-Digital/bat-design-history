We added a [notification banner](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/notification-banner/) to the start page and claims list page to highlight when the deadline for claim submission is.

The notification banner includes the message:

> You must submit a claim by 11:59pm on Friday, 19 July 2024.

In both instances, this banner duplicated content already available on the page, but we have found that users often ignore persistent content.

When we close the claim submission window, the notification banner will no longer appear, and the ‘Add claim’ button will also be hidden.
