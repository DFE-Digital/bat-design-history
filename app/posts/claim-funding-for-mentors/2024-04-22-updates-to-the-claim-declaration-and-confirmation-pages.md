Users must agree to a declaration when they submit a new or draft claim.

We updated the declaration to include a bullet point that they have read and accepted the grant terms and conditions.

The declaration now reads:

> By submitting this claim, I confirm that:
>
> - I am authorised to claim on behalf of the school
> - I have read and accepted the grant terms and conditions
> - the information detailed above is accurate, and the total I am claiming back has been used to support the cost of the mentor training
> - I will provide evidence to support this claim if requested by the Department for Education

We also updated the claim confirmation page to state that the claim will be shared with their provider. This is important as providers ensure the training is carried out.
