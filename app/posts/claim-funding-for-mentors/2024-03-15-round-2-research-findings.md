## Who we spoke to

- 3 x public beta users
- 2 x private beta users

Of which:

- 1 x Executive principle
- 1 x Business manager/Provider
- 3 x Headteacher

Of which:

- 3 x Multi Academy Trust
- 2 x Local Authority Maintained

## Goals of the research

- Test users’ understanding of the service and how it works based on our content iterations for ‘make a claim’ and ‘add a mentor’ journeys
- Continue to gain a better understanding of who the users of the new ITT grant funding claim service are
- Continue to gain more context regarding our users, their behaviours and mental models
- Explore users’ expectations of the following steps post-submission
- Explore what users expect to happen if they are nominated for sampling – understand if they would be comfortable providing evidence via email to DfE
- Begin exploring possible names for the service

## What we tested

- 2nd iteration of ‘add a mentor’ and add a ‘claim journey’
- 1st iteration of a start page

## Key insights

### Persona insights

A key observation was that users’ ability to understand the service and how it works was influenced by their prior knowledge of the new service. Some users had already understood the new grant funding scheme, while others hadn’t.

Trusts expect to be able to submit claims centrally on behalf of other schools.

They felt that making claims at an individual school level would burden schools too much.

Administration and data handling is done at a central level within trusts; therefore, submitting claims at a central level feels more appropriate.

### Start page

The start page made users feel much more informed regarding what the service is.

They understood what was required of them to complete a claim.

They reported that at this point in the journey, they would ensure they have the information they need before starting the service.

They require clarity on the information that they need to complete a claim.

This included:

- Provider details – what details regarding their providers do they need to locate
- Hours of training – more information is required around the requirements for hours of training

There was slight confusion around what training they were claiming for.

Some users became confused when reading the service description and questioned whether they were claiming for the training that mentors undertook or the training they did with placements/trainees.

Guidance was ‘hidden’ within related content

Users felt the guidance wasn’t ‘prioritised’ enough on the page and, therefore, would miss it. They described ‘related content’ as something relevant but unimportant to the service. They said that they expected links within the page content where they could read further information on the areas they required more clarity on.

### Add a mentor or make a claim

The order of the primary navigation confused the steps they had to take to complete a claim.

The order of the primary navigation confuses users. They assume that it indicates the order of the steps they must take.

Once users complete the ‘add a mentor’ journey, they refer to the primary navigation to try and understand what to do next, as we don’t currently have a link directing them to the next step (‘add a claim’).

### Hours

The hours’ descriptions made users feel more informed about the service's rules. However, they still require further clarification.

Users understood that 20 hours is the maximum number of hours they can claim. However, they still struggled to understand what 6 hours meant.

Seeing ‘other amount’ alone on the page also led to confusion, and it wasn’t until they expanded this option that they understood that you could enter hours ‘up to’ 20 hours.

### Sampling

They expect to be asked to provide evidence, but being asked to do so via email is a concern for them as it feels ‘unsafe’. They expect to be able to upload evidence to a portal and feel that doing so will be more secure.

### Funding amount

Users reacted positively to the funding amount they would receive based on location. They said it’s not a lot, but it covers the training, which is positive.

They also felt positive that providing an opportunity to claim funding means that DfE acknowledges the impact of taking time out to train ITT placements on schools.

## Emerging user needs


## Hypothesis to test in round 3

### Hypothesis 1

We have seen users getting confused regarding the order of steps throughout the service
We think this is because the service is not a linear journey, and therefore are using the primary navigation as an indication of the following steps
So if we add content to emphasise the order of tasks
Then users will feel confident in choosing their next steps.

### Hypothesis 2

We have seen users requiring reassurance that their claim has been successfully submitted
We think this is because they don’t currently receive confirmation once a claim is submitted
So, if we provide a confirmation email
Then users will feel reassured that DfE has successfully received their claim.

### Hypothesis 3

We have seen users not confidently understanding what the service is for when at the start
We think this is because this is a brand-new service, and they don’t know how it works before using it
So, if we iterate the content to be more specific
Then users will have a better understanding of the service.
