After private beta users had submitted their claims, we changed the start page content based on user feedback and behaviour.

We also changed the start page based on insights gained in [Round 1 research findings](/claim-funding-for-mentors/round-1-research-findings) and [Round 2 research findings](/claim-funding-for-mentors/round-2-research-findings).

We added the new content to the prototype to test with users during [round 8 of user research](/claim-funding-for-mentors/round-8-public-beta-placement-school-research-findings/), which was with public beta placement schools, including those not well represented in the private beta.

The updated start page tested well, so we updated the live service with the content from the prototype.

## What we changed

We made several changes to the start page.

We added initial teacher training (ITT) to the first paragraph to clarify which type of mentor this service is for. This change resulted from several Support queries from users trying to claim their early career framework (ECF) mentors.

We added in the ‘Who can use this service’ section. This eligibility criteria is designed to help users identify if the service is for them to reduce the cognitive load on our users.

We added inset text to describe who this service is not for (early career mentors).

We updated the ‘When to submit a claim’ section to reflect the dates in the public beta.

We separated the dates across multiple sentences as a result of accessibility research.

In the ‘Before you start’ section, we added ‘you should check these with your provider’ to the requirement for completed training hours. This addition was based on feedback during user research with accredited providers who advised us that they would be best placed to know this information.

We want to prepare the user for what will happen next, so we have included information about DfE sign-in and why it is needed to access the service.

We will review the start page and iterate on it if users or further research suggest we update it.
