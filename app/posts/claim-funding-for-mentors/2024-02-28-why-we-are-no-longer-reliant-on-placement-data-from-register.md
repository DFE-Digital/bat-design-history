During alpha, we assumed that placement data would be required to validate the eligibility of the placement school to receive funding.

During private beta, we decided not to validate the placement school and accredited ITT provider relationship using data from our services. One of the primary reasons for this is that the data may be available after the due date to process the claims from July. This is because accredited ITT providers and schools sometimes agree on the second placement after January, when the deadline is to upload the placement schools’ information to the Register trainee teachers service.

In addition, our assurance plan requires accredited ITT providers to provide evidence of delivering the training to the placement school mentors. This independent evidence will be sufficient to demonstrate that the school was eligible for funding.

Where there are concerns that a school may not be eligible for funding but has made a claim, we could ask the school to provide the trainee’s teacher reference number (TRN), which we could use to validate that a trainee teacher was undertaking training with an accredited ITT provider at the school.

*[ITT]: initial teacher training
*[TRN]: teacher reference number
