## Who we spoke to

All participants in this round of research were either mentors or worked in a Local Authority Maintained school.

Participant 1: Mentor Leadership and Support

Participant 2: Head Teacher

Participant 3: Director of Business Outreach

## Goals of the research

The goals of the research were to:

- understand how specific types of schools experience making claims using the new service.
- identify if these users experience pain points when using this service
- gather feedback on the prototype and compare it to previous research

## Key insights

All participants had a positive reaction to the start page. The purpose of the service and who it was for was clear and easy to understand.

Some users felt that the grant conditions page was too long, and they would have preferred the information to be divided into sections. Additionally, some felt the information was only accessible to users with sufficient prior knowledge.

There were no issues with the add mentor journey. However, inputting the date of birth information could be smoother (e.g. automatically moving between the day, month and year as the participant typed it out).

When making a claim, it would be helpful for some users to have information on inputting multiple claims, as explained by some participants.

The “submitted claims page” was received positively regarding its potential value to finance procedures.

Participants responded positively when asked about a sampling scenario but stated they would prefer to submit sampling evidence to the original claims portal.

## Next steps

We recommend prioritising the updating of the start page so that it is live when the service moves into public beta.

As the other issues listed above were minor, we recommend the public beta team consider which they would like to prioritise and move forward.

For this round of research, we attempted to recruit the following school types:

- independent schools
- free schools
- local authority special schools
- pupil referral units
- further education colleges
- early years settings

Two participants could not attend the sessions due to sickness and technical issues, so we could not talk to any of the above types of schools. The public beta team will need to attempt engagement with these different school types again to ensure the service works for them.
