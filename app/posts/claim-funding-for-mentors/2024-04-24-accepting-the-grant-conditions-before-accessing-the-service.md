Before submitting claims, a person with the appropriate authority at the school must accept the grant conditions.

We added a way for users to accept the grant conditions before accessing the service and making claims.

## How it works

When a school’s first user signs in to the service, we show them the [grant conditions](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/663b32391834d96a0aa6d1f8/General_mentor_training_conditions_of_grant.pdf) (227KB PDF) for the service.

At the bottom of the page of conditions, we show a warning message:

> By selecting ‘Accept grant conditions’, you declare that you have read and agreed to the above grant conditions as an authorised representative of [SCHOOL NAME].

We include a button labelled “Accept grant conditions” that a user must select before continuing.

Only one user from a school needs to accept the grant conditions. All subsequent users will not need to accept the conditions but can view them via a link in the footer.

We show who accepted the grant conditions in the organisation details section.
