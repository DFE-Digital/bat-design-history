## Who we spoke to

6 x school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) providers
4 x higher education institution (HEI) providers

Of which:

- 2 x small
- 6 x medium
- 2 x large

## Goals of the research

The goals of this round of research included understanding:

- how much support can we expect from providers to communicate the grant conditions with schools and encourage them to use the service
- what providers need from us to enable effective communication about the service with schools
- if our sampling approach will work within their current processes
- how much visibility they require of submitted claims

## Key insights

**Providers have close relationships with schools and see themselves as key players in communicating with them about the new service.**

Communication with mentors happens regularly (often weekly) and is specific to training.

Communication at a school level happens less often (quarterly or termly) and is related to strategy, funding and partnership agreements.

**Within SCITTs, delivery partners are responsible for communicating with schools regarding training and funding and logging and tracking completed training and hours.**

This adds a layer of communication and responsibility we should be aware of.

**Providers must encourage schools to take up mentoring, help their partner schools understand the benefits, and encourage them to apply for funding.**

Due to busy schedules and a lack of staffing in schools, mentoring take-up is slower than providers would hope. They also told us that they lack an understanding of the benefits of doing so, and the DfE can help by communicating this to schools.

Related to the previous finding, they said **‘How we frame the funding requirements and communicate this to schools is key to getting them to use the service.’**

The term ‘20 hours’ of training is off-putting to them. They think they are required to do more training than they already are. However, this isn’t the case.

**Tracking mentor training and the number of hours completed can be done manually via spreadsheets or by using software such as Mosaic.**

Whether or not they use software depends on whether they have the budget or if it is fit for purpose. The software enables them to track and monitor more effectively and in real time.

The larger the provider (meaning they serve more schools across several locations), the more software requirements they have. One large provider we spoke to still uses spreadsheets, as all the software they have investigated does not provide the functionality they require.

**There were concerns from providers that schools would not claim funding to their full advantage.**

This is due to:

- not having the capacity to submit claims
- inaccuracy of data
- not understanding the full benefits to them

For this reason, they felt that providers would be best placed to make the claims on behalf of schools.

### Feedback on our sampling approach

Providers were expected to provide evidence of some sort, so informing them that they would have to sample claims didn’t surprise them.

They felt that our sampling timeframes were reasonable and said they could complete sampling within the proposed timeframes.

All providers accurately track training and hours so they can cross-reference claims with their data. However, the data we provide is insufficient for them to do this.

They predict that schools will make inaccurate claims as they do not have the same amount of information as providers. Due to this, there were concerns about the process for incorrect claims and how much work this would require. This gets more complex as the provider grows larger. Communicating with schools will be a massive job for them.

Once we told them how the sampling process works and made them aware that they are responsible for investigating incorrect claims with schools, they said they would add an extra step in their processes: They would send schools a list of what they should be claiming for ahead of the claim window. This is in the hope that it will reduce the number of incorrect claims and, therefore, the amount of work they must do to investigate claims.

## Next steps

Review the data we include in the CSV we send to providers for sampling and ensure it matches the data required for providers to cross-reference against their data.

Add information within the guidance, encouraging providers to send schools a list of claims ahead of the claim window opening to improve the accuracy of submitted claims.
