We added the grant conditions to the service so that our private beta users can view and agree to them.

Users can view the grant conditions via links in the:

- footer
- ‘Grant funding’ section on the organisation details page

These grant conditions will not be published on GOV.UK, as the grants for 2023 to 2024 academic year are only for two accredited providers: the National Institute of Teaching (NIoT) and Best Practice Network and their placement schools.

The funding available to all accredited providers and placement schools for initial teacher training (ITT) for the academic year 2024 to 2025 has been published on GOV.UK:
