In previous work, we added a way to [show all submitted claims in Support](/claim-funding-for-mentors/showing-submitted-claims-in-support/).

## What we changed

We have:

- added secondary navigation
- added all claim statuses to the status filter
- reorganised the order of the filters

### Secondary navigation

We added secondary navigation to the claims section. The navigation includes items for:

- all claims
- payments
- sampling
- clawbacks
- activity log

The ‘All claims’ list includes all claims created in the service. Support users can download the claims based on the filtered criteria.

The payments, sampling and clawbacks sections contain actions related to each workflow.

The activity log section shows an audit log of all actions support users carry out via the payments, sampling and clawbacks sections. It does not show actions carried out by school users, such as amending a draft claim.

### Claim status filter

As part of the payments, sampling and clawback work, we updated the status filter on the ‘All claims’ list to include all claim statuses:

- draft
- submitted
- payment in progress
- information requested
- information sent
- paid
- payment not approved
- sampling in progress
- provider not approved
- claim not approved
- clawback requested
- clawback in progress
- clawback complete

### Order of filters

We moved the ‘Accredited provider’ filter above the ‘Schools’ filter.
