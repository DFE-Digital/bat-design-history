Claim funding for mentor training launched its private beta service with around 300 education organisations in May 2024.

The first claim window closed on 19 July 2024. Two additional claim windows were opened in late July 2024 and again in September to give schools that missed the first claim window an additional opportunity to claim and to allow schools to withdraw any incorrect claims.

361 claims were made via the service, with £396,763.25 claimed in total. These claims are still subject to the assurance process.

In total, 234 education organisations made a claim, which is about 72% of the private beta cohort.

An average of £1,696 was claimed per organisation.
