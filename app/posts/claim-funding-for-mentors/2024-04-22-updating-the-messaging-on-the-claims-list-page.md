After [round 3 of user research](/claim-funding-for-mentors/round-3-research-findings/), we updated the claims list page to clarify that users must add at least one mentor before creating a claim.

We made this change because [users continue to get confused as to where they go to claim after adding a mentor](/claim-funding-for-mentors/round-3-research-findings/#users-continue-to-get-confused-as-to-where-they-go-to-claim-after-adding-a-mentor).

After adding mentors, no specific call to action directs users to make a claim. They must navigate to the ‘Claims’ section.

The primary navigation is ordered with ‘Claims’ first and ‘Mentors’ second. This is because ‘Claims’ are the most important and common action, but is the opposite of what we initially asked them to do: add mentors and then create a claim.

To address this user need, we added the inset text “Before you can start a claim, you will need to add a mentor” below the page heading and link to the ‘Mentors’ section.

In subsequent rounds of research, we will test whether this has reduced users’ confusion when they first log into the service.
