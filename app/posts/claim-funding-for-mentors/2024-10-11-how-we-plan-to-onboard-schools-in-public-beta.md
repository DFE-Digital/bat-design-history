In the private beta, we onboarded eligible placement schools by exporting a list from Register trainee teachers (Register). We gave this list of schools to the early adopter providers who sought consent from colleagues in these schools to pass their contact information to us so we could onboard them onto the service.

This process was laborious and only possible because there were approximately 300 private beta schools. Replicating this process in the public beta with approximately 15,000 schools would have been impossible.

In public beta, we will again export a list of eligible placement schools from Register to onboard the organisations. To onboard the users, we will provide the placement school's unique reference number (URN) to the DfE Sign-in team through a service now request.

The DfE Sign-in team will then provide the first name, last name and email of all active approvers and end users.

We will then onboard these users onto the service, which will generate an email advising them they can now log in.

The Office of the Data Protection Officer approved this process, which was agreed upon by the DfE Sign-in team.
