Following design advice, we have decided to remove the red links and reposition them below the heading of each appropriate section.

Previously, when a user wanted to delete something from the service, we included a link to begin the removal process. This link was red to match the subsequent delete action, which used a red button.

While red links are not included in the GOV.UK Design System, the approach has been used on several other services in Becoming a teacher (BAT) and the broader government, including, but not limited to:

- Emergency Alerts
- GOV.UK Collections Publisher
- GOV.UK Content Publisher
- GOV.UK Notify
- GOV.UK Pay
- HMPPS Book a secure move
- HMPPS Send money to someone in prison
- Publish teacher training courses
- Register trainee teachers

We will revisit this decision in the future if circumstances change.
