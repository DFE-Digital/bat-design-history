Due to some placement schools missing the first deadline to claim (claim window), we decided to experiment by quietly re-opening the service to new claim submissions. This would extend the original deadline to schools that still wanted to submit a claim. If this helped to increase the number of ‘on-time’ submissions, we would not need to officially re-open the service in September for placement schools who had missed the claim window.

A second official claim window would result in payments in December, and assurance work would be undertaken into early 2025. Extending the private beta assurance processes into 2025 would require additional DfE resources.

We would also use this opportunity to gather insights into why users had not submitted before the deadline.

## Why placement schools missed the original deadline

Users contacted the support team primarily because they had issues with DfE Sign-in (94 tickets out of 252 as of 31 July). DfE Sign-in is how schools and other education organisations access DfE online services and is used extensively across Teacher Services.

 These issues prevented schools from submitting claims before the window closed. The support team compiled a list of 13 schools that requested to submit claims after the original claim window had closed.

## Claim funding for mentor training – external dependencies

Our service (Claim) has several key external dependencies which determine when the claim windows can open and close, in addition to the use of DfE Sign-in.

Firstly, it is reliant on the Register trainee teacher service for the list of placement schools to onboard into the service. Accredited providers submit this information in January, from the September to August academic year. This data is made available to Claim in February.  The service cannot open before this information is received and the first users from these placement schools are onboarded.

Secondly, funding is paid by the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA). As part of their agreement to facilitate the payments to placement organisations, they have stipulated when they require payment forecasts and actuals. For the private beta they requested the first forecast by 25 July. This date, together with the end of the summer term for many schools in England, provided the rationale for closing the first claim window on Friday, 19 July.

ESFA require a second, more detailed forecast by Friday, 16 August, before the actual payment totals need to be supplied by Friday, 6 September.

These dependencies provided an opportunity for the Claim team to re-open the claim window between the two forecast dates and add the new claims to a revised second forecast by 16 August without requiring a separate payment window and assurance timeframe.

The rationale for this is that it would enable those placement schools to be paid together with all schools from September and for all the assurance activity to begin in October.

However, for this experiment to work, all placement organisations that missed the first deadline must submit by Friday, 9 August.

## Will we need to extend deadlines for public beta?

We will likely not need to re-open the claim window in August for the public beta, as there will be an official second claim window, from September 2025. This claim window has been agreed with ESFA due to the anticipated volume of placement schools (approximately 15,000). These payments will be made from December 2025, and the assurance activity will continue in early 2026, finishing by the end of the 2025-26 financial year (April 2026).
