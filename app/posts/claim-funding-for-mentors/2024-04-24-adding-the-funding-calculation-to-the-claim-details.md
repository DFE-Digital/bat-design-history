We added how we calculate the claim amount to the claim details to help users understand how much money they will receive.

## Calculating the funding

The amount of funding schools will receive depends on:

- the location of the school
- how many hours the mentor has spent training

For each mentor who completes the full 20 hours of training, the funding available is up to:

- £876 (£43.80 per hour) — for schools outside London (the rest of England)
- £902 (£45.10 per hour) — for schools in the fringe region (the area between outer London and the rest of England)
- £965 (£48.25 per hour) — for schools in outer London
- £1,072 (£53.60 per hour) — for schools in inner London

We calculate the funding on a per-hour basis. For example, if a mentor in a school outside London completed 10 hours of training, the school can claim £438. We calculate this amount at £43.80 (per hour) x 10 (hours of training).

## How it works

When we onboard a school to the service, we use the school’s address to allocate a funding region. We use this region in the fee calculation.

We show the fee calculation to users on the following pages:

- claim details
- check your answers
- declaration

The grant funding section of the three pages includes:

- total hours claimed
- hourly rate - for example £45.10
- claim amount
