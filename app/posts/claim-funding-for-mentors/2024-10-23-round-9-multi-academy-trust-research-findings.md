## Goals of the research

Understand how multi-academy trusts (MATs) currently manage finances. Is this done at an individual school level or centrally?

Test the new iterations of the start page. Do users better understand what the service is and who it is for?

Understand how MATs will use the service. Will they make claims at an individual school level or centrally?

## Who we spoke to

All schools included in the research were Multi Academy Trusts. We ensured a geographic spread.

Participants included:

- 2 headteachers
- 1 vice principal
- 1 initial teacher training (ITT) Coordinator
- 1 improvements officer focused on ITT coordination

## Key insights

Users could confidently understand the service and who it is for when reading through the start page.

They reported that the start page is really clear and informative. When asked to summarise the service and who it is for, they were able to explain the service correctly.

They all pointed out that the content stating that the service was not for ECF mentors was particularly helpful.

Whether or not schools will make claims centrally or at an individual level depends on the school.

As assumed, there was no exact answer for this. All the schools we spoke to said that funding is assigned to each school, and activities like this would usually be done at an individual school level.

It is important to note that all of the MATs we were able to speak to only had a small number of schools, so this may vary depending on size.

However, when testing the ability to ‘change organisation’ and make a claim on behalf of another school, they said it was very easy.

## Next steps

Our research has informed us that the journey to changing organisation and submitting claims on behalf of other schools is easy to use. Therefore, changes are only needed if data or support requests tell us otherwise when we go live with the public beta.
