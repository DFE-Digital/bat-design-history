The funding rate for schools classified as ‘outside London (the rest of England)’ is £43.80 per hour.

However, when schools in this funding band submitted claims between 2nd May and 19th July, the hourly rate shown in the service was £43.18. This mistake was due to a keying error in the prototype, which carried over to the live Claim funding for mentor training service.

Fortunately, a user alerted us to the error.

## How we fixed this

We corrected the funding rate in the live service to rectify this. This correction updated the value of the impacted claims, and the total amount claimed increased by £3,318.86.

We informed the 148 impacted organisations that had already claimed via email and updated their claim values.

To avoid errors like this in the future, we will implement an updated review checklist that requires the signoff of crucial information, including funding rates and claim windows.
