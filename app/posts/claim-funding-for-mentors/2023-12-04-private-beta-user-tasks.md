As part of the handover from the discovery and alpha team, the private beta team reviewed the high-level [user needs](/claim-funding-for-mentors/mentoring-discovery-phase-user-needs/).

These user needs were broad and related to mentoring across both initial teacher training (ITT) and the early careers framework (ECF).

By referencing these user needs, the private beta team added five high level user needs that address the problem that the Claim Funding for Mentor Training service (Claim) solves which are detailed in [user needs and user tasks](/claim-funding-for-mentors/user-needs-and-user-tasks).

## User tasks

Throughout private beta, we created a list of user tasks. Working with user tasks enabled the design and development team to create user journeys and features specific to the tasks or that our users need to complete, whilst keeping the overarching user needs of the service in mind.

### User types

When breaking down the journey into user tasks, we first identified all the users who would interact with the Claim service:

- School user who would submit a claim
- Multi-academy trust user who submit claims on behalf of multiple schools within their trust
- Accredited ITT provider user who would need to support school users and be responsible for auditing claims
- Internal support colleagues, responsible for administering the service, undertaking the payment, auditing and clawback processes, as well as communicating with both school and provider users

Below is the full list of user tasks for each user type.

#### School user tasks

## Next steps

These user tasks will inform the design and build of the claim service so that schools can receive all the funding that they are entitled to for their ITT mentor training.
