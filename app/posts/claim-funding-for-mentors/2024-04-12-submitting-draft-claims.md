In a previous piece of work, we added a way for support users to [add claims on behalf of schools](/claim-funding-for-mentors/adding-claims-in-support-on-behalf-of-schools/).

Support users cannot submit claims as school users must agree to a declaration before submitting the claim. This constraint means that claims created by support users are in a ‘draft’ state.

## What we changed

We added a way for school users to submit draft claims.

## How it works

[![Submit draft claim flow](submit-draft-claim--flow.png 'Submit draft claim flow')](submit-draft-claim--flow.png)

From the claim details page, the ‘Submit claim’ flow has two steps:

1. Check your answers
2. Confirmation

### Check your answers

On the check your answers, we show:

- school
- accredited provider
- mentors
- hours of training - for each mentor
- claim amount

Users can change:

- accredited provider
- mentors
- hours of training - for each mentor

Users must agree to a declaration when submitting the claim.

### Confirmation

When the draft claim is submitted, we show a confirmation page that includes a:

- reference number
- description of what happens next
