In May 2022, the Department for Education (DfE) published guidance on the [funding to aid in the delivery of reformed Initial Teacher Training (ITT) courses] (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-reform-funding-guidance) leading to the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) from the 2024 to 2025 academic year onwards.

In addition to funding for accredited providers, placement schools can access grant money to support the new training requirements of school-based mentors.

Schools can claim for the actual hours of training undertaken by the mentor to a maximum of 20 hours per provider.

‘Track and pay’ is the service that will facilitate the funding claims that placement schools make.

For further information on schools’ role in supporting initial teacher training and mentoring, please see the [Why are we working on school placements design history](/manage-school-placements/why-school-placements/).

## Discovery phase

In June 2022, a discovery focused on ensuring that schools and mentors can effectively deliver the new mentoring requirements for the Early Career Framework (ECF) and the ITT Market Review presented its recommendations.

One of the agreed recommendations was to run an Alpha phase to define the core feature set of the funding system to facilitate payment of the general mentor grant to placement schools.

The agreed recommendation was to run a 16-week Alpha​ building on the discovery to conduct direct research and develop options.

​The initial options identified to explore include​:

- developing claims-based processes for schools​
- expanding current services such as Register trainee teachers or continuing professional development (CPD) to enable ITT mentor tracking – and passing data to the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) to pay schools​
- creating a bespoke end-to-end service

## A bespoke claim form

One of the reasons why a bespoke service for schools is required is the feedback from the ECF team provided during the Discovery.

Schools stated that the ECF payment service was complex as it required information to be inputted by schools, mentors and providers. In addition, claims were processed based on information supplied by providers, not schools. This has resulted in schools failing to associate their funding with mentor training. As a result, the ‘Track and pay’ service will enable schools to submit their claims.
