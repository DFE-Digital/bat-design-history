We added a simple way to export claims so that support users can send claim details to accredited providers for review or the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) for payment.

## How it works

We have included a ‘Download CSV’ button above the list of claims.

The download claims functionality works with the search and filters on the claims list. For example, if a user filters the claims list by a particular accredited provider and selects the ‘Download CSV’ button, only the claims that match the filtered criteria will be included in the CSV file.

The CSV file includes the following information:

- claim reference
- unique reference number (URN) of the school
- school name
- local authority name
- claim amount
- establishment type
- date submitted

*[CSV]: Comma-separated values
