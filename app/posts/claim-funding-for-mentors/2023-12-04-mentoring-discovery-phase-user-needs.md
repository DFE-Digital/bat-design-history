## Why we did this

One of the key goals of a [discovery phase]( https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works), is to "start learning about our users and their context.” [What to find out in a discovery]( https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works#what-to-find-out-in-discovery).

In particular, the team should find out who the users are and what they are trying to do [user research in discovery]( https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/user-research-in-discovery).

## Users

During the discovery phase, the team identified three distinct user groups involved in initial teacher training (ITT) mentoring:

- mentors who undertake the training and support the trainees during their placement
- schools that take trainee teachers on placements (placement schools)
- accredited providers who are the legal entity accredited by the Department for Education (DfE) to deliver teacher training leading to qualified teacher status (QTS) and are responsible for developing the mentor training curriculum
-

## Next steps

By using these user groups and associated needs the private beta team were able to begin to understand what the users of Claim funding for mentor training wanted to achieve from the service.

However, to help design and build the service the team needed to identify the user tasks that the users would undertake, so that schools could claim funding for their mentor training successfully, as well as ensuring that all relevant assurance checks were completed.
