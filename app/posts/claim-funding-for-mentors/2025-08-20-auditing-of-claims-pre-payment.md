After the private beta we reviewed the claims which had been made in error and required a refund of funds from schools to the Department for Education (DfE).

During this process we found the majority of erroneous claims were made because schools had claimed for their early career teacher (ECT) mentors, rather than their initial teacher training (ITT) mentors.

We therefore took the decision to introduce additional, pre-payment auditing of claims for the public beta.

## Policy and background

The [Initial teacher training (ITT): criteria and supporting advice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-criteria) states that all ITT mentors should receive sufficient high-quality training to ensure they can effectively support a trainee teacher to obtain the knowledge and skills they need to successfully complete their school placement.

For the 2024/25 academic year, DfE made grant funding available to schools to cover the cost of school-based mentor training.

The [Initial teacher training reform funding guidance: 2024 to 2025]( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-reform-funding-guidance) sets out the parameters for how much funding schools can claim.

For a school to claim this funding, the mentor must:

- be employed by the school making the claim
- undertake up to 20 hours of initial mentor training, per accredited ITT provider
- mentor at least one trainee, or have intended to mentor a trainee (as evidenced by schools arranging placements for ITT trainees at their schools)

Schools can only claim funding for one mentor per trainee, unless the mentor withdraws.

If the mentor role is undertaken by staff on a job-share basis then the school can claim full funding for both staff members.

The Claim Funding for Mentor Training (Claim) service was open to a limited number of schools in 2023/24.

For 2024/25 all schools with eligible mentors were able to access the Claim service and input their claims for 2024/25.  

## Comparing data sets from Claim and Register Trainee Teachers service

To check that mentor numbers were aligning approximately with the number of trainees in schools we compared the Claim and [Register]( https://www.register-trainee-teachers.service.gov.uk/) data sets.

Register is the service where trainees are recorded along with the placement schools that they attended during their training. It therefore provides a definitive list of trainees and associated placement schools.

We took each school that had added at least one mentor to the Claim service and compared the number of mentors added to the number of trainees registered.

Where there were more mentors than trainees, we sent out comms to reiterate the rules around claiming mentor funding.

Many of these claims will fall under the allowable exemptions from the one mentor to one trainee rule listed above.

However, we wanted to ensure that schools were not claiming funding that would later need to be paid back (clawed back) to DfE.  

## Outcome

Emails were sent to all schools that had a higher number of mentors in the Claim service than trainees in Register.

This meant that in some cases multiple users emailed regarding the same school.

In some cases, such as multi-academy trusts, where claims were being made on behalf of multiple schools from a central source, it wasnâ€™t clear to the user which schools had a discrepancy.

This meant working with the support team to identify the schools that required a review.

Some schools had added mentors to the system but had not made a claim for these mentors.

Others had added ECT mentors [Eligibility and funding for the early career teacher entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-and-eligibility-for-ecf-based-training) which receive funding via a different scheme and service.  

## Next Steps

To ensure that future claims for mentor funding are made accurately DfE will periodically check claims alongside data from the Register service and email users where we believe that providers may have made an error.

In addition, we will explore ways to more specifically target communications to the relevant users so that the schools with possible errors are highlighted to the user.
