## Goals of the research

The goals of this round of research included understanding if the support team can:

- adopt our sampling and payment approach
- navigate through the process easily using the support console

## Methodology

We did not have a working prototype ready for this research, so the support team could not interact with the service. However, we were able to show them print screens of mockups and use this as an opportunity to understand their expectations of how the functionality and journey should work.

Because the support team is new to the payments and sampling process, we asked scenario-based questions to help them gain context and asked them to explain how they would complete specific tasks.

## Key insights

Participants clearly understood the tabs—Payments, Sampling, and Clawback. They go through similar processes with other funding services, so they also know what to expect when navigating to these sections of the service.

Filters are useful to them – they will allow them to quickly access specific claims.

## Improvements required

Clear instructions are required when uploading and downloading CSV files. Feedback included:

- “Where do we send the CSV to?”
- “What happens if more than one person does this? Will the service know?”
- “Which email address do we send it to?”
- “Which claims do we need to include in the CSV?”

Participants felt they needed to upload and download CSV files too often and asked if they could streamline this process. This will become a burden when we go live with public beta and many placement schools make claims.

Where we have action buttons at the top of the pages, participants mistook these as filters. Once we told them how they worked, they asked for some text to be added underneath them specifying what they needed to do with them. This indicates that these buttons’ purpose is unclear and requires improvement.

Participants questioned if any personal information would be stored within the CSV. This was a concern for them.

## Next steps

Adopt a simpler approach to the initial screen in the payments tab. Users expressed confusion about what and when to upload and download.

To remedy this confusion, we are automating the download and sending of the CSV and separating the upload functionality. This should assist users to step through the flow more intuitively.

Furthermore, we are including changes to show who uploaded what and when and a way for users to see those claims again if they want to.

Other simplifications include removing bulk actions and filtering on the payments tab to reduce the information a support user needs to process in the user interface.

We are planning another session with support to get feedback on the updated designs.
