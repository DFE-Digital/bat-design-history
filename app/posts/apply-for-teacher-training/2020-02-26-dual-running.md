During the 2019/20 and 2020/21 recruitment cycles, providers can offer training courses through UCAS Teacher Training and/or Apply.

At the start of the transition period, most courses will only be available through UCAS, but some regions will have SCITTs offering courses across both services (a situation that is often referred to as ‘dual running’).

This obviously adds confusion to an already complex process, so we should help candidates understand which service is best suited to their needs.

## User needs

{% from "user-need/macro.njk" import appUserNeed %}
{{ appUserNeed({
  description: "As a candidate
I need to easily understand whether to use Apply or UCAS for my application
So that I can choose the service that suits me best"
}) }}

{{ appUserNeed({
  description: "As a candidate
I need to know which apply service(s) my chosen course(s) is available on
So that I do not waste time filling out an application that I cannot submit"
}) }}

{{ appUserNeed({
  description: "As a candidate
I need to know that I can apply for three courses across both services
So that I understand my options"
}) }}

{{ appUserNeed({
  description: "As a candidate who’s choices are on Apply
I need to know that I should use Apply
So that I can submit my application more easily"
}) }}

## Hypotheses

### Starting an application journey from the start page

If a candidate starts their application journey from the start page, they could complete the application before choosing a course, only to discover that it’s not available on Apply.

- If we include a link to providers available on Apply to the start page
  Then candidates can see if their chosen course is available on Apply.

- If we add dual running guidance to this list of available providers
  Then candidates will be better understand what their options are.

- If we add a page that recommends making course choices before completing other sections of the application
  Then candidates will not feel they’ve wasted their time entering information into a service they cannot use.

### Application journey from Find

If a candidate starts (or continues) their application journey from ‘Find for postgraduate teacher training’, then we show them an interstitial page explaining the two options, and ask them to choose which service they would like to use.

- If we clearly state the reasons why you might want to use each service
  Then candidates will be better able to make an informed choice.

- If we make the options on this interstitial page radio buttons
  Then candidates will see that they have two options.

- If we skip this intertitial page for users already signed into Apply, and show a confirmation page instead
  Then candidates will not be asked to make the same choice over and over again.

### Redirecting candidates (back) to Find

If a candidate hasn’t chosen a course yet, we direct them to use Find. However, users are then not able to navigate back to Apply, and potential face the challenge of being caught in a loop.

- If we open the link to Find in a new window
  Then candidates will be able to keep their location on Apply.

### Redirecting candidates to UCAS

If a candidate selects a course that is not available on Apply, we tell them that the service is not ready for them yet.

- If we direct candidates to a page that tells them they need to apply for this course on UCAS (and show the provider and course codes they will need)
  Then candidates will not feel like they’ve reached a dead end.
