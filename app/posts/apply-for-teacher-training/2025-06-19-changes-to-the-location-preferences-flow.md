## Background

The user research with candidates that we did between 19 to 27 May 2025 uncovered some problems with the way we were asking candidates to set location preferences.

### Content and labelling

The title ‘location preferences’ wasn’t clear to all participants. Whilst most of them eventually understood that it was places they would train or teach, it was not obvious or instinctive to them when looking at the page.

It was also not clear how setting a location preference would impact the searches they would appear in results for and the courses they would be invited to apply for.

### Understanding and setting a distance

The distance element was confusing for participants. The default distance of 10 miles was abstract for candidates who thought about commutes in terms of travel time rather than distance. Our analysis shows that a lot of candidates are not changing the default distance which seems to support the research insight that candidates do not understand it and it does not resonate with them.

International candidates treated the distance from a given location differently to domestic candidates. International candidates tend not to have specific location preferences, however rather than setting no preferences – to indicate that they can train anywhere – they are setting wide distance radii from many locations to indicate that they can travel anywhere in the UK. Our analysis has shown distances of 200 miles added, in the research some participants added either 1000 miles, or 0 miles to indicate that they are happy to train anywhere in London or Manchester.

Some international participants said that they wouldn’t necessarily know the names of different locations in the UK in order to set them as preferences, and would prefer a drop-down list to select from.

### Add locations checkbox

Finally, there is a checkbox on the set location preferences screen that we tested that automatically adds the location of any new courses that someone applies to to their preferences.

Participants did not always notice this checkbox and some confused it with the add locations button.  

## What we did

### Content and labelling

We changed ‘location preferences’ to ‘areas you can train in.’ We felt that ‘area’ described a location plus a radius better. We also thought that describing what the location is (somewhere you will do your training) and does (tells providers where you can train) would make it clearer what the benefit of adding or updating this was.

We changed the order and the labelling of both the column headers on the locations page and the page where you change or update locations. By placing the distance first and labelling it ‘I can travel up to’ [miles] ‘from town city or postcode’ we felt that it read more naturally as a sentence and is clearer what the distance refers to (travelling time). We hope this will make it more intuitive to users.

### Understanding and setting distances

Because it was clear that international candidates (or anyone who doesn’t have a specific location preference) was adding wide travelling distances from lots of locations rather than setting no preferences at all, we added a question before the location preferences setting to ask if they have any location preferences.

If they do not have any preferences then they are not directed down the location preference setting route. They will appear in all location search results with the label ‘open to courses anywhere.’

Only people who select location preferences will be directed down the location preference setting route. We thought that the hint text on the ‘In specific locations’ radio box would further reinforce the reasons for adding location preferences.

### Add locations checkbox

Because this feature was being missed or confused at the bottom of the location setting screen, we moved it onto its own screen. We thought that this would make it clearer that it does something distinct from adding your own location preferences.

Having this as a question in its own right in the flow also gave us more time to explain what selecting yes would do. We hope this will make it clearer what the purpose and value of this feature is.

## What’s next?

We will continue to monitor the distances that candidates are setting to see whether changing the flow has supported candidates who can train anywhere to reflect this accurately in their preferences.

We will re-test the location flow in the next round of user research with candidates to check that the changes we have made have solved the problems we saw in the ways we expected them to and not caused unexpected issues elsewhere.  

Recent provider research has shown that providers are not 100% trusting of the locations that candidates have set. Especially for candidates who are open to courses anywhere, providers seemed to think that this didn’t mean what they said it meant. This could impact whether or not providers feel confident to invite a candidate to their courses.

We will think about ways we can encourage providers to trust in the preferences that candidates have set. Some UR participants suggested showing the specific locations and distances that a candidate had selected on their profile.
