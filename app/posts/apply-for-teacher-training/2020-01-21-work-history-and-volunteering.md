title: The difference between work history and volunteering
description: The content on the work history and volunteering pages had conflicting information.
---
We want candidates to tell us about their paid work experience on one page and their unpaid experience or volunteering on another page.

This is one way of presenting work history to providers.

We need candidates to input their work history correctly so that we can assess whether this approach is useful for providers.

Clarifying the guidance on these pages should ensure that:

* candidates don't duplicate information across both sections
* omit information which could be relevant to their application

## User needs

As a provider, I need enough detail about a candidate’s work history, unpaid experience and volunteering so that I can make decisions on their application.

As a candidate, I need to show my work history, unpaid experience and volunteering so that I can demonstrate my suitability or potential for teaching.

## Hypotheses

If we don't clarify the [guidance on the work history page](http://localhost:8080/apply-for-teacher-training/work-history-and-volunteering#guidance-on-work-history-page), candidates might omit paid work which wasn't related to working in a school or with children, because the content suggests we only want to know about 'paid work in school'.

## How will we know it works?

 We’ll know this works when candidates have no difficulty filling out these sections of the application form.
