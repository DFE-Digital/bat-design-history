description: Let a candidate add 2 new referees

A follow up to the [design for adding a single new referee](/apply-for-teacher-training/add-a-new-referee).

Key differences are:
- after adding the first referee the candidate is taken to a form to add a second referee
- these forms refer to the first and second referees
- the review summary shows both of the newly added referees
- titles and labels refer to "2" or "each referee" or "referees"
