![Illustration with the text: "Safeguarding: references to be collected if you accept an offer (incomplete)""](/apply-for-teacher-training/asking-candidates-for-references-to-be-contacted-if-they-accept-an-offer/references-to-be-collected.png)

We’ve [changed the references process](/apply-for-teacher-training/collecting-references-after-offer/) so that candidates only need to give details of people who can give references, rather than having to request and receive references before submitting their application.

## The issue

We needed to update the application interface, which previously required candidates to request references and then once these had been received, select which 2 to include with their application. Instead we just needed to collect the details of at least 2 people who could give a reference.

We also needed to communicate this change for any candidates who may have been familiar with the previous process.

## What we changed

We made changes to the:

- application task list
- journey for adding a reference - including the introduction and check answers page, plus pages asking for the type of reference, name, email address, how the candidate knows the person
- references review page

We no longer use the word “referee” to describe someone who gives a reference. The term may not be recognised by all candidates and is more commonly associated with sport.

### Application task list

[![Screenshot showing the previous and new application task lists. The previouis version includes "References: your application needs to include 2 references. You can request as many as you like to increase the chances of getting 2 quickly. Once you’ve received 2 or more references, you can select the 2 you want to include in your application." The new version includes: "Safeguarding: references to be requested if you accept an offer."](application-task-list-before-and-after.png "Application task list: before and after")](/apply-for-teacher-training/asking-candidates-for-references-to-be-contacted-if-they-accept-an-offer/application-task-list-before-and-after.png)

Previously there was a dedicated section of the main application task list for references.

The section appeared after the courses section and before the qualifications section. This was to encourage users to request references before entering qualifications and writing a personal statement, since references could take a while to receive.

Within the section, there were two tasks:

- Request your references
- Select 2 references

The [select 2 references task](/apply-for-teacher-training/selecting-references/) was added in 2021. It allowed candidates with more than 2 references to select which ones to include in their application, rather than always including the first 2 to be received.

With the new process, references no longer need to be received before submitting the application. There is therefore no need to select which 2 to include.

We no longer have a references section in the task list. Instead we’ve added it as a task within the existing safeguarding section. This helps to convey that references are now only used for safeguarding purposes, rather than to assess candidate quality.

When we did usability testing with the task called ‘References’, many participants incorrectly assumed that people would be contacted straight away. So we renamed the task ‘References to be requested if you accept an offer’.

### Introduction page

We found that many research participants did not read the page at the beginning of the references journey. So we simplified it and reduced the amount of text on it.

![Screenshot showing text: Requesting a reference. Referees should not be family members, partners or friends. If you graduated in the last 5 years, or you do not yet have a grade for your degree, choose at least one academic referee. If you’re applying for a salaried course, one of your references must be from an employer. You can use one character reference if you also have a professional or academic reference. Get more tips on [choosing your referees]. Contact your referee: Your referee will receive a link to an online form to complete. Contact your referee in advance to check that they can: type or paste their reference into an online form, with a 500-word limit (some referees can only send references by email, but these are not accepted), submit a reference quickly, so as not to delay your application, give you a full reference – providers need to know if you’re suitable to become a teacher](references-intro-old.png "Previous references introduction page")

![Screenshot showing text: References to be requested if you accept an offer. You need to give details of 2 people who can give a reference for you. They’ll only be contacted if you accept an offer on a course. You should include: an academic tutor if you graduated in the past 5 years or are still studying, the headteacher if you’ve been working in a school. They’ll be asked if they know any reason why you should not work with children.](references-intro.png "Updated references introduction page")

We removed the section suggesting that candidates should contact people whose details they give. This is no longer relevant since references will not be requested until the candidate accepts an offer.

We used bullet points to give guidance on who to choose to give a reference, to make it easier to scan.

We removed the guidance that “if you’re applying for a salaried course, one of your references must be from an employer.” We could not find evidence for this rule and some applicants may not have an employer.

We added guidance that candidates should include the headteacher if they have been working in a school. This is based on the Keeping Children Safe in Education policy guidance.

### Type

![Screenshot showing question: What type of reference do you want to add? Option: Academic, such as from a university tutor. Option: Professional, such as from a manager. Option: School experience, such as from the headteacher of a school you’ve been working in. Option: Character, such as from a mentor or someone you know from volunteering.](type-of-reference.png)

We changed the question to “What type of reference do you want to add?” so that we could remove the word “referee”.

We removed all the hint text and instead included the examples in the labels. This simplified the design and makes it more likely that the hint text will be read.

We changed “School-based” to “School experience” to make it clearer that this refers to working or volunteering in a school. It does not refer to when the candidate was studying at school.

### Name

![Screenshot showing question: What’s the name of the person who can give you a reference? Do not give details of a family member, partner or friend.](reference-name.png)

We changed the question from “What is the referee’s name?” to “What’s the name of the person who can give you a reference?” This lets us avoid the term ‘referee’.

We added the hint text “Do not give details of a family member, partner or friend.”

### Email address

![Screenshot showing question: What is Jane Smith’s email address? Give their work email address if they have one.](reference-email.png)

We changed the question from “What is the referee’s email address?” to “What is [name]’s email address?” This avoids the term ‘referee’ and also makes their name more visible than when it was shown before the question using grey text.

We changed the hint text from “Use their professional email address if they have one.” to “Give their work email address if they have one.”

### How you know the person page

![Screenshot showing question: How do you know Jane Smith and how long have you known them? For example, ‘They are the head coach for my athletics club. I’ve known them for 5 years.’](reference-how-known.png)

We changed the question from “How do you know this referee and how long have you known them?” to “How do you know [name] and how long have you known them?” This avoids the term ‘referee’.

We also added the text “We’ll show your answer to [name] and ask them whether it’s correct” to make it clearer what this question is used for.

### Check your answers

![Screenshot showing page with the heading 'Check your answers before sending your request'. The page then summarises the reference questions, and asks 'Are you ready to send a reference request to Jane Smith?' with the options 'Yes, send a reference request now' and 'No, not at the moment'](old-check-answers-page.png "The previous Check your answers page")

We removed this page, as reference requests are no longer sent at this point.

### References review page

![Screenshot showing page with the heading 'References to be requested if you accept an offer'. It contains the same content as the introduction page, and then displays a green button labelled 'Add another reference' and then summarises the details of 1 reference given](references-review.png)

After adding a reference, candidates return to a review page which lists the details of all references added. Each reference has links to change details or delete a reference.

There’s also a button to “add another reference”. Its location at the top of the page makes it more visible. It’s also consistent with other sections which use a similar pattern, such as qualifications and work experience.

The button is green when details have only been added for one reference. This is because the candidate must add details for at least 2 references.

![Screenshot showing page with the heading 'References to be requested if you accept an offer'. It contains the same content as the introduction page, and then displays a grey button labelled 'Add another reference', then summarises the details of 2 references given, and then asks 'Have you completed this section?' with the options 'Yes, I have completed this section' and 'No, I’ll come back to it later'](references-done.png)

When at least 2 references have been added, the button is grey. The question “Have you completed this section?” is added to the bottom of the page, with a green button to continue.

If a user marks the section as completed but then returns and deletes references so that they have less than 2, the section switches back to incomplete.

## Research

We did usability testing on the new flow with 8 participants who had previously applied for teacher training.

We found no major usability issues.

Participants could usually remember the names of who they’d ask for a reference, but might have to look their email address up.

When answering 'how do you know them and how long have you known them?' all participants used the hint text as a guide for how much to write.

All participants said they’d only add 2 people, and weren’t clear why they could add more.

Some participants were still unsure of when references would be contacted.

## Future considerations

We could consider splitting "How do you know [name] and how long have you known them?" into two separate questions. This might make it easier to answer, and help make sure that all users answer both parts of the question.

The guidance around who needs to be asked for a reference could be clearer. This would require a more consistent policy across all providers.
