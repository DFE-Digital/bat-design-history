For the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle, we’ve [changed the references process](/changing-the-reference-process-to-make-it-easier-for-candidates-to-submit-applications) so that candidates:

- only need to give details of people who can give references, rather than having to request and receive references before submitting their application
- must confirm these details when they accept an offer, so that reference requests can be sent
- can check on the progress of reference requests - this includes requesting more, cancelling requests and sending reminders

## The issue

## What we changed

We made changes to the:

- application task list
- journey for adding a reference - including the introduction and check answers page, plus pages asking for the type of reference, name, email address, how the candidate knows the person
- references review page

We no longer use the word “referee” to describe someone who gives a reference. The term may not be recognised by all candidates and is more commonly associated with sport.

### Application task list

Previously there was a dedicated section of the main application task list for references.

The section appeared after the courses section and before the qualifications section. This was to encourage users to request references before entering qualifications and writing a personal statement, since references could take a while to receive.

Within the section, there were two tasks:

- Request your references
- Select 2 references

The [select 2 references task](/apply-for-teacher-training/selecting-references/) was added in 2021. It allowed candidates with more than 2 references to select which ones to include in their application, rather than always including the first 2 to be received.

With the new process, references no longer need to be received before submitting the application. There is therefore no need to select which 2 to include.

We no longer have a references section in the task list. Instead we’ve added it as a task within the existing safeguarding section. This helps to convey that references are now only used for safeguarding purposes, rather than to assess candidate quality.

When we did usability testing with the task called ‘References’, many participants incorrectly assumed that people would be contacted straight away. So we renamed the task ‘References to be requested if you accept an offer’.

### References introduction

We found that many research participants did not read the page at the beginning of the references journey. So we simplified it and reduced the amount of text on it.

We removed the section suggesting that candidates should contact people whose details they give. This is no longer relevant since references will not be requested until the candidate accepts an offer.

We used bullet points to give guidance on who to choose to give a reference, to make it easier to scan.

We removed the guidance that “if you’re applying for a salaried course, one of your references must be from an employer.” We could not find evidence for this rule and some applicants may not have an employer.

We added guidance that candidates should include the headteacher if they have been working in a school. This is based on the Keeping Children Safe in Education policy guidance.

### Type of reference

We changed the question to “What type of reference do you want to add?” so that we could remove the word “referee”.

We removed all the hint text and instead included the examples in the labels. This simplified the design and makes it more likely that the hint text will be read.

We changed “School-based” to “School experience” to make it clearer that this refers to working or volunteering in a school. It does not refer to when the candidate was studying at school.

### Name of the person who can give you a reference

We changed the question from “What is the referee’s name?” to “What’s the name of the person who can give you a reference?” This lets us avoid the term ‘referee’.

We added the hint text “Do not give details of a family member, partner or friend.”

### Email address page

We changed the question from “What is the referee’s email address?” to “What is [name]’s email address?” This avoids the term ‘referee’ and also makes their name more visible than when it was shown before the question using grey text.

We changed the hint text from “Use their professional email address if they have one.” to “Give their work email address if they have one.”

### How you know the person page

We changed the question from “How do you know this referee and how long have you known them?” to “How do you know [name] and how long have you known them?” This avoids the term ‘referee’.

We also added the text “We’ll show your answer to [name] and ask them whether it’s correct” to make it clearer what this question is used for.

### Check your answers before sending your request


We removed this page, as reference requests are no longer sent at this point.

### References review page

After adding a reference, candidates return to a review page which lists the details of all references added. Each reference has links to change details or delete a reference.

There’s also a button to “add another reference”. Its location at the top of the page makes it more visible. It’s also consistent with other sections which use a similar pattern, such as qualifications and work experience.

The button is green when details have only been added for one reference. This is because the candidate must add details for at least 2 references.

When at least 2 references have been added, the button is grey. The question “Have you completed this section?” is added to the bottom of the page, with a green button to continue.

If a user marks the section as completed but then returns and deletes references so that they have less than 2, the section switches back to incomplete.
