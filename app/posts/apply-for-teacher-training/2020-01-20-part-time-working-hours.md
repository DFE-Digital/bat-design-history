title: Working patterns for part time jobs
description: Adding a place for candidates to describe their working pattern
---

We ask candidates to select 'full time' or 'part time' for their work history entries.

Some providers say that 'part time' doesn't give enough detail. It could mean a candidate has worked 5 hours or 25 hours, for example.

UCAS asks for working hours for all jobs. We're not sure if this is necessary, because:

* the difference between 20 and 22 hours, for example, isn't significant
* a full time job shows a level of commitment, whether it was 37 hours or 40 hours

## User needs

As a provider, I need enough detail about a candidate's work history so that I have enough information to make decisions on their application.

As a candidate, I need to be able to describe my part time jobs, so that I can show how much work I did.

## Hypotheses

 If we ask for the working pattern (rather than the number of hours):

 * then it will be easier for candidates to fill out the application form
 because they won't have to find out the number of hours they worked in each job

 * then providers will still have the information they need
 because the working pattern will show a candidate's level of commitment

 * then providers will still be able to make decisions on a candidate's application
 because they'll have detailed picture of a candidate's work history

### When will we know this works?

 We'll know this works when candidates can describe their part time jobs in a way that's useful for providers.
