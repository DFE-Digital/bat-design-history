title: Working patterns for part time jobs
description: Adding a place for candidates to describe their working pattern
---

We currently ask candidates if their employment was full time or part time. A few providers have suggested that 'part-time' is too broad (being anything up to 35 hours).

* As a provider, I need to know the working pattern for a part time job, so that I can know the level of commitment.
* As a candidate, I need to accurately describe my part time jobs... 

## Hypotheses

UCAS asks for working hours for all jobs. Teacher training providers have said they want to know how many hours a candidate has worked in their part time jobs.

 If we ask for the number of hours, then it might be difficult for candidates to work this out. Furthermore - the difference between 20 and 22 hours, for example, is not significant.

 If we ask for the working pattern (rather than the number of hours), then it will be easier for candidates to fill in because they won't have to recall the number of hours they worked in each job.

 If we ask for the working pattern for a part time job, then providers will be able to make decisions more easily on a candidate's application because they'll have a better understanding of a candidate's work history.

 We don't need to ask about the working pattern for full time jobs, because full time is a significant commitment.

 We'll know this works when candidates can describe their part time jobs in a way that's useful for providers.
