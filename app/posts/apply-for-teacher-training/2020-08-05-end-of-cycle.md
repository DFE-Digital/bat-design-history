description: Letting candidates know about courses closing and reopening while encouraging them to pursue their application.

Some candidates drop out of the application process over the summer.

They’re not aware of application deadlines, and are disappointed when courses become full without warning.

We’re gathering evidence about how effective the existing recruitment process is – so it’s too early to rethink policies.

However, we can adapt Apply for teacher training to help keep candidates engaged over the summer.

## Hypothesis

If the recruitment process is more transparent, candidates will be more empowered and able to pursue an application.

## User needs

As a candidate
I need to know that places can fill up at any time
So that I can be proactive, for example:

- finishing my application quickly
- choosing a referee who can respond quickly
- chasing my referee
- staying in touch with my provider

As a candidate
I need to know when the application deadline is
So that I do not miss out

As a candidate
I need to know when applications reopen
So that I can prepare

## Design

### Showing the deadline for candidates applying for the first time

The deadline to submit an application is 24 August for candidates applying for the first time.

This banner appears for candidates who:

- are applying for the first time
- create an account by 24 August

The banner will show until 24 August.

Rather than simply giving a deadline, we are transparent about the fact that courses can fill up at any time.

Asking candidates to talk to their provider may help them understand course availability and take appropriate action.

### Showing the deadline for candidates applying for the second time

The deadline is 18 September if you’re applying again.

This banner appears for candidates who:

- are applying for the second time
- start their second application by 18 September

The banner will show until 18 September.

Again, we’re transparent about the fact that courses can fill up at any time, and advise candidates to contact their provider.

### Showing the deadline for candidates who are in between applications

We’ll show a variation of the existing [Do you want to apply again?](/apply-for-teacher-training/apply-again/#apply-again-banner) banner.

This appears for candidates who have finished an application without accepting a place, but have not started a new application yet.

This banner will show until 18 September.

After 18 September, we inform candidates that applications reopen from 13 October – rather than showing them the above message.

### Telling candidates what to do if they have an application in progress and miss their deadline

If a candidate misses their deadline they have to wait until 13 October to submit.

This banner appears on the main menu for candidates who:

- created an account by 24 August
- did not submit by their deadline

![Banner informing candidates when applications reopen.](your-application-with-opening-date.png)

Asking the candidate to come back at a later date shows that their work is not wasted.

### Preventing candidates from adding courses after their deadline

We’ll prevent candidates from adding courses if they miss their deadline because course availability may change between recruitment cycles.

Instead of asking candidates to choose a course, we’ll let them know that they can find courses from 13 October:

### Preventing candidates from submitting after their deadline

We’ll also prevent candidates from submitting if they miss their deadline.

Instead of a submit button, we’ll invite candidates to review their application:

![Button inviting candidates to review their application.](your-application-review.png)

This may encourage candidates to continue their application even if they cannot submit.

It may also reassure them that they can come back to their application.

### Preventing candidates from starting an application

New candidates cannot create an account after 24 August, until 13 October.

We took this decision to simplify a potentially complex and painful user journey. A candidate could create an account only to learn that they cannot submit or find courses during certain periods.

If a candidate tries to create an account between 25 August and 12 October we’ll show this message:

![Create an account page with message informing candidates that applications have now closed.](create-an-account.png)

In the future we could reconsider the recruitment process – perhaps allowing candidates to create an account all year round.
