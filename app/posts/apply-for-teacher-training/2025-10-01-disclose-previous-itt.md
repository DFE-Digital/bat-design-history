## Background

We have received feedback from training providers that some candidates that they have offered places to had joined an initial teacher training (ITT) course in the past and left.

Whilst there may be legitimate reasons for starting and leaving a course before reapplying (such as illness or a change in circumstances) there could also be safeguarding concerns.  

The ITT criteria (C1.3) state that accredited ITT providers must conduct appropriate preselection checks to help to protect children and young people from trainee teachers who might put them at risk of harm because their previous conduct shows that they are unsuitable for teaching.  

This includes ‘checking that a trainee has not previously been removed from an ITT programme because they have behaved in a way that indicates that they may not be suitable to work with children, or if the previous accredited ITT provider would have removed the trainee had they not left.’

### User needs

As a provider, I need to know whether a candidate has previously commenced training and the outcome so that:

* I can make a decision about the candidate’s suitability to teach
* I can take challenges they faced into consideration when allocating placements

As a candidate, I need to declare whether I have previously started training and the outcome, so that:

* I can be redirected to more appropriate routes into teaching if needed (for example, if I have qualified teacher status (QTS) already, or an overseas teaching qualification)
* any unsuccessful or uncompleted previously training doesn’t unfairly impact my recruitment chances

Currently we use data from Register trainee teachers to identify candidates who have withdrawn from a course in the past and we email the training provider they have applied to, to recommend that they contact the candidate and the previous provider. This is a manual process.

## What we did

We have added a new question to the safeguarding section of application details where candidates can disclose any previous ITT courses they have started.

We considered including this new question in the qualifications section of application details but we are not interested in candidates disclosing types of training that are not ITT. To prevent providers from sifting through lots of irrelevant information, we decided to be clear that we are asking about this for safeguarding reasons.  

If they answer yes to this question we will ask them to provide some details about the course:

* the name of the training provider
* the start date of the course
* the date they left the course

There is then a free-text field for them to add any information that they feel is important for the training provider to know. They can explain the reason that they left the course which will help the training provider to know whether they need to take anything into consideration when offering a place.

We had originally designed a more structured journey where we ask candidates if they have completed the course, whether they received a qualification and what the qualification was, whether they withdrew for reasons such as illness, which would allow us to sift out people who are disclosing previous training but did not leave for safeguarding reasons.

However there was a feeling that we’d like to encourage training providers to read this part of the application in all circumstances and use the information to make their own decision. If the data we provide allows them to filter some disclosures from others then it might mean some falling through the cracks.

We had some concerns that a free-text field was too open and unstructured for us to get the type of information that we need from it. Some candidates may give lots of irrelevant information, and others might give single word answers, neither of which would be useful for us or the training provider.

However it was felt that we should make a simple text-field live and monitor the text that is entered there to see if there’s a clear way to structure it in future.

Directing people to alternative routes into teaching is not the primary need for this new question, so we also deprioritised this more structured journey. We will however direct people who already have QTS or QTLS to the return to teaching service from the check your answers screen. We know that ‘already has QTS’ is a rejection reason that is used so ideally we would redirect these candidates to avoid wasting their own and providers’ time in applying.

Candidates cannot edit this part of their application after they submit an application. They need to submit a request to the Support team to make any changes on their behalf.

### Updates following free-text analysis

On 1 October 2025 we analysed the free-text that candidates were entering and noticed that 26 out of 58 of people were using this question to share information about their teaching qualifications.  

We have updated the question to make it clear we are asking about ITT in England specifically and directing them to enter any successful qualifications in the qualifications section of Apply:

### Providers’ view

The training providers will see the information about the previous training in the candidates’ application. They are encouraged to contact the candidates to discuss it with them initially. They can then request a reference from the previous training provider as a condition of any offer they go on to make.

## Next steps

Self-disclosure isn’t the most robust means of collecting this safeguarding information. We are relying on candidates sharing accurate information about their past teacher training.

The Register trainee teachers service holds data on everyone who has started ITT in England. In future, we should be able to share this data with training providers so that they can see who has started ITT before without relying on candidates to disclose this.

We will also monitor the frequency of people withdrawing from more than 1 previous course. The current design does not allow candidates to add more than 1 previous course, although they can mention others in the free-text field.
