An alternative to the [account and password design](/apply-for-teacher-training/apply-june-2019/create-account).

Users had trouble with accounts:

* they didn’t know which GOV.UK account to use
* some didn’t know why they were making an account
* Only ask for an email address, and explain why we need it.
