During August and September 2023, we planned a series of email communications to candidates to help them prepare for the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle for initial teacher training (ITT).

## The issue

The 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle starts on the second Tuesday of October every year. This year, that date was 10 October 2023.

To help candidates prepare for the new cycle, we put together an email communication plan with our policy colleagues.

Every year we need to send emails to candidates and training providers, this plan would help us write and send emails in good time. It would also help us next year when we need to do this again.

View what we sent to training providers who use Manage teacher training applications (Manage).

## What we did

### 15 September 2023 – email to candidates to submit any applications before the end of the cycle

This email was to remind candidates who had unsubmitted applications to submit them before the end of the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle.

Email content:

Once a recruitment cycle ends, candidates can ‘carry over’ their unfinished application to the next cycle if they want to continue applying.

Email content:

### Automated emails from Apply for teacher training (Apply)

When the new recruitment cycle starts, Apply sends 2 automated emails to candidates, these go when:

Find postgraduate teacher training (Find) opens on the first Tuesday in Octobers every year

Apply opens on the second Tuesday of October every year

When Find opens, candidates can start looking for courses and prepare their applications. When Apply opens, candidates can start submitting their applications.

Email when Find opens:

### 10 October 2023 – telling candidates we’ve updated our terms and conditions.

For the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle, we updated our terms and conditions because we [changed the way the application process works](/apply-for-teacher-training/changing-application-process).

We sent an email to candidates with a link to our terms and conditions to notify them of this change.
