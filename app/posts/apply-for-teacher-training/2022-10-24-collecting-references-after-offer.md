![Flow diagram previous and new flows. In the previous flow, references are requested, then 2 are selected before sending the application. In the new flow, reference details are collected, then the application is sent, then an offer is received, then reference details are checked and then references are requested.](references-flow-changes.png)

We changed the way that references are requested, so that this now happens after an offer has been accepted, instead of as part of the application.

This change was made for the start of the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle, beginning on 7 September 2022.

## The issue

Candidates previously had to get 2 references before they could submit their application. This caused problems because:

- courses could become full while a candidate waited for their references
- some candidates would need to ask their employer for a reference, revealing that they were planning on leaving their job even though they did not have a place yet
- candidates were not always sure who to ask for a reference, for example if they had been caring for a child for a number of years

In addition, receiving references with the application meant that providers used them as part of assessing candidate quality.

Research suggests that references are not a reliable way to assess whether a candidate is suitable for teacher training because people giving references:

- may not like to give negative references, or be told not to do so by the organisations they work for
- could be biased, whether intentionally or not
- may not know the candidate well enough to give a detailed reference

References were found to very rarely lead to rejection. Almost all rejections mentioning references were due to concerns about a candidate working with children.

We wanted to find a way to:

- make it easier for candidates to submit applications
- move the focus of references away from assessing the quality of candidates
- check whether there’s evidence that it is not safe for candidates to work with children
- reduce the amount of work done by people giving references, particularly those such as academic tutors who do so regularly

## Analysis

Analysis of data in May 2022 found that:

- 93.5% of candidates with unsubmitted applications had not completed the references section
- 2,011 candidates with unsubmitted applications only had the references section left to complete
- 49.4% of the candidates with only references left to complete had not entered details of anyone who could give them a reference
- 46.2% were awaiting a response for at least one reference

This suggested that changes to the references process could lead to significant increases in the numbers of candidates recruited.

## What we changed

We changed the application form so that candidates no longer need to request and receive 2 references.

Instead, candidates just need to give details of at least 2 people who can give a reference if they later accept an offer. Providers see these details but are told not to use them to contact people who can give references.

When a candidate accepts an offer, they have to review the list of people which they gave when they applied. They can add or delete people from the list. After any changes, there must be at least 2 people in the list in order for the candidate to accept the offer.

When the candidate accepts an offer, this triggers emails to the people they said could give a reference.

The people who can give references are asked to give a factual reference, for example about the candidate’s role and responsibilities. They’re no longer asked whether the candidate will make a good trainee teacher.

Providers can see references as soon as they are given.

Other design history posts will cover these steps in more detail.

## Other approaches we considered

We considered only asking candidates to give details of people who could give a reference after they accepted an offer, and did some design and research on [making references an offer condition](/manage-teacher-training-applications/making-references-an-offer-condition/). This would be easier for candidates, but providers had concerns about not knowing that the candidate have people to ask for references.

We also debated removing the process of requesting references from the service altogether and instead requiring providers to handle this themselves as part of their enrolling process.

The approach we adopted was a compromise between improving the experience for candidates and not requiring too much change from providers.

## Future considerations

We will review the success of the new process midway through the cycle in November.

We plan to:

- ask providers how the process is working for them
- evaluate whether the changes is encouraging more candidates to apply
- check that candidates are still able to receive references in a timely manner
- consider further changes to the Manage interface to enable reference requirements to be more clearly communicated to candidates
