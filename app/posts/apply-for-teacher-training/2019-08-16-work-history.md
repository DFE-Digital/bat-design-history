title: Work history - August iteration
description: Move guidance into a question.

Following on from [the original design](/apply-for-teacher-training/apply-june-2019/work-history), rather than using multiple details elements and two submit button weâ€™ve shaped the guidance as a question and used routing based on their answer to send users to the right place.

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [
    { text: "Work history" },
    { text: "Job" },
    { text: "Out of the workplace" },
    { text: "Review work history" }
  ]
}) }}
