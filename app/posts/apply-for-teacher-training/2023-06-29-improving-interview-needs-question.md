As part of our work to [change the application process](/apply-for-teacher-training/changing-application-process/), we improved the content on the question that asks candidates if they have any interview needs.

## The issue

When we first designed the course flow as part of changing the application process, we moved the ‘Interview needs’ question to a new tab called ‘Your applications’.

After testing this flow, we decided to move the question back to the ‘Your details’ tab so candidates can complete it as part of the task list.

## What we changed

In moving the question back to the task list, we improved the content too. The content still included information about COVID-19 and linked to another question about adding adjustments if a candidate had any disabilities or health conditions. This was confusing for candidates, and we found that they often mentioned their disabilities in the ‘Interview needs’ question. There is another section called ‘Ask for support if you’re disabled’ where candidates should be entering information about any disabilities or health conditions.

We also found that the term ‘interview needs’ was not clear.

We changed the heading to ‘Interview availability’ to make it clearer that we’re asking the candidate to describe their availability for interviews with providers.

We also mentioned some examples of when they might not be available, such as holidays booked or caring responsibilities. This enabled us to reduce the content on the page to make it easier for candidates to understand what we’re asking about.
