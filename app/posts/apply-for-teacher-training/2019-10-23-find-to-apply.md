An iteration following [an early 2019 design of the journey](/find-teacher-training/choose-how-to-apply-2).

This design includes:

* an interstitial showing the choice between GOV.UK Apply and UCAS Apply
* a page adding the selected course as a choice in a new application

It doesn’t cover the journey from Find for a user with an existing account or application.

The journey intentionally skips the Apply start page, going straight from the interstitial to the eligibility questions. A ‘Start now’ button doesn’t fit well in the middle of a journey. With the start page being hosted on GOV.UK, this would create a technical challenge: how would we maintain a choice from Find to GOV.UK and onwards to Apply.

To skip the start page, the content on the Apply and Find start pages must be consistent.
