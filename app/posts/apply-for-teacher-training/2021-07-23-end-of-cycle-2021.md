## Communicate upcoming deadlines

### Inform candidates applying for the first time about their deadline

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "candidate-applying-first-time-starts-application-before-deadline.png"
  },
  caption: "Deadline banners start to show approximately one month before the deadline to apply."  
}) }}

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "candidate-applying-for-the-first-time-gets-nudge-with-deadline.png"
  },
  caption: "Nudge emails get sent approximately 2 months and then one month before the deadline to apply."   
}) }}

### Inform candidates applying again about their deadline

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "candidate-applying-again-banner-with-deadline.png"
  },
  caption: "Deadline banners start to show approximately one month before the deadline to apply."
}) }}

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "candidate-applying-again-gets-nudge-with-deadline.png"
  },
  caption: "Nudge emails get sent approximately 2 months and then one month before the deadline to apply."
}) }}

## Allow candidates to 'carry over' their applications

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  'Carry over' is an internal term we use to describe copying an application from one cycle to the next. We do not use this terminology on the service.
</div>

### Candidates who do not submit by their deadline need to 'carry over' their application to continue working on it

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "continue-application-unsubmitted.png"
  },
  caption: "Candidates are presented with an interstitial page when they sign in. They need to click continue to carry on with their application for courses starting in the 2022 to 2023 academic year."
}) }}

### Candidates who did not get a place in time to start a course in the 2021 to 2022 academic year can carry over their application

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "application-unsuccessful-no-longer-possible-to-apply-for-the-same-cycle.png"
  },
  caption: "Guidance appears on the post-submission dashboard when the deadline to apply again has passed and the application did not lead to a place. By clicking 'apply again', the candidate carries over their application to the next cycle."
}) }}

#### If the application does not lead to a place after the deadline to apply again has passed

As well as the above inset text, the usual 'apply again' email is amended to reflect the year candidates can apply in.

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "apply-again-email-no-longer-possible-to-apply-for-courses-starting-in-the-same-academic-year.png"
  },
  caption: "Guidance appears on the post-submission dashboard when the deadline to apply again has passed and the application did not lead to a place. By clicking 'apply again', the candidate carries over their application to the next cycle."
}) }}  

## Stop candidates selecting courses between cycles
