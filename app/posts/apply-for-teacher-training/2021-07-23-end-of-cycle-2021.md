## Candidates are informed about their deadline to apply

### Candidates applying for the fist time

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "candidate-applying-first-time-starts-application-before-deadline.png"
  },
  caption: "Deadline banners start to show approximately one month before the deadline to apply."  
}) }}

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "candidate-applying-for-the-first-time-gets-nudge-with-deadline.png"
  },
  caption: "Nudge emails are sent approximately 2 months and then one month before the deadline to apply."   
}) }}

### Candidates applying again

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "candidate-applying-again-banner-with-deadline.png"
  },
  caption: "Deadline banners start to show approximately one month before the deadline to apply again."
}) }}

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "candidate-applying-again-gets-nudge-with-deadline.png"
  },
  caption: "Nudge emails are sent approximately 2 months and then one month before the deadline to apply again."
}) }}

## If a candidate does not submit by their deadline

### They need to 'carry over' their application to continue working on it

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "continue-application-unsubmitted.png"
  },
  caption: "An interstitial page is shown on sign in (from 6pm on 7 September 2021 for candidates applying for the first time and 6pm on 21 September 2021 for candidates applying again). Clicking continue carries over their application to the next available cycle."
}) }}

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  'Carrying over' is a term we use internally to describe copying an application from one cycle to the next, but we do not use this terminology with candidates.
</div>

### If they carry over before Apply reopens, they cannot submit

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "carried-over-apply-not-open-yet.png"
  },
  caption: "A banner lets candidates know that applications are not open at the moment but that they can apply from 9am on 12 October 2021."
}) }}

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "submit-button-disabled.png"
  },
  caption: "The submit button is disabled and candidates are informed that they can apply from 9am on 12 October 2021."
}) }}

### If they carry over before Find reopens, they cannot find courses

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "carried-over-find-closed.png"
  },
  caption: "Candidates cannot find courses if they carry over before Find has reopened."
}) }}

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "courses-closed-review-page.png"
  },
  caption: "The courses closed message shows on the review page too."
}) }}

## Candidates who applied in time but did not get a place

### If there's still time to apply in the same recruitment cycle

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "normal-email-apply-again.png"
  },
  caption: "Candidates get the usual 'apply again' email inviting them to apply again in the same recruitment cycle."
}) }}

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "application-unsuccessful-still-time-to-apply.png"
  },
  caption: "If they log in before the deadline to apply again, they'll see the usual 'apply again' message but with the addition of a deadline banner. They can apply again in the normal way, up until the deadline to apply again."
}) }}

### If it's too late to apply in the same recruitment cycle, they need to 'carry over' their application

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "application-unsuccessful-no-longer-possible-apply-again.png"
  },
  caption: "As soon as the deadline to apply again has passed, the message in the 'apply again' inset text changes - letting the candidate know they can apply for the next cycle. Clicking 'apply again' carries over their application."
}) }}

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}
{{ appFigure({
  image: {
    file: "apply-again-next-cycle.png"
  },
  caption: "If the application does not lead to a place when the deadline to apply again has already passed, the usual 'apply again' email changes to reflect this."
}) }}
