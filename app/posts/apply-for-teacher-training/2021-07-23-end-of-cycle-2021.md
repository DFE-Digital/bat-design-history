![Deadline notification banner on application menu.](candidate-applying-first-time-starts-application-before-deadline.png)

Nudge emails are sent approximately 2 months and then one month before the deadline to apply:

{% from "email/macro.njk" import appEmail %}
{{ appEmail({
  subject: "Submit your application before courses fill up",
  content: "### Complete your teacher training application – courses fill up quickly at this time of year

Submit your application as soon as you can to get on a course starting in the 2021 to 2022 academic year:

((sign_in_url))

The deadline to submit your application is 6pm on 7 September 2021 but courses may fill up before then.

}) }}

![Deadline notification banner on application menu.](candidate-applying-again-banner-with-deadline.png)

Nudge emails are sent approximately 2 months and then one month before the deadline to apply again:

{{ appEmail({
  subject: "Submit your application before courses fill up",

}) }}

## If a candidate does not submit by their deadline

### They need to ‘carry over’ their application to continue working on it

An interstitial page is shown on sign in (from 6pm on 7 September 2021 for candidates applying for the first time and 6pm on 21 September 2021 for candidates applying again). Clicking continue carries over their application to the next available cycle:

![Interstitial page is shown on sign in.](continue-application-unsubmitted.png)

{% from "dist/govuk/components/inset-text/macro.njk" import govukInsetText %}
{{ govukInsetText({
  text: "‘Carrying over’ is a term we use internally to describe copying an application from one cycle to the next, but we do not use this terminology with candidates."
}) }}

### If they carry over before Apply reopens, they cannot submit

A banner lets candidates know that applications are not open at the moment but that they can apply from 9am on 12 October 2021:

![Notification banner on application menu.](carried-over-apply-not-open-yet.png)

The submit button is disabled and candidates are informed that they can apply from 9am on 12 October 2021:

![‘Review’ section of application menu.](submit-button-disabled.png)

### If they carry over before Find reopens, they cannot find courses

Candidates cannot find courses if they carry over before Find has reopened:

![Message shown in ‘Courses’ section of application menu.](carried-over-find-closed.png)

The courses closed message shows on the review page too:

![Message shown in ‘Courses’ section of application review page.](courses-closed-review-page.png)

Candidates currently do not receive an email on their deadline to let them know that it’s no longer possible to apply for courses starting in the 2021 to 2022 academic year but that they can continue applying. We should review this, as candidates can work on their application even if applications are not open.

However, [candidates get an email letting them know that courses are open](/apply-for-teacher-training/end-of-cycle-2021/#letting-candidates-know-that-courses-are-open).

## Candidates who applied in time but did not get a place

### If there’s still time to apply in the same recruitment cycle

Candidates get the usual ‘apply again’ email inviting them to apply again in the same recruitment cycle:

{{ appEmail({
  subject: "Update on your application – all decisions now made",
  content: "Dear ((first_name)),

### Update on your application

Western Kemmer College has decided not to make you an offer to study Computer Science (ILWE). They’ve given feedback to explain this decision.

}) }}

If they log in before the deadline to apply again, they’ll see the usual ‘apply again’ message but with the addition of a deadline banner. They can apply again in the normal way, up until the deadline to apply again.

![Notification banner on application menu.](application-unsuccessful-still-time-to-apply.png)

### If it’s too late to apply in the same recruitment cycle, they need to ‘carry over’ their application

As soon as the deadline to apply again has passed, the message in the ‘apply again’ inset text changes – letting the candidate know they can apply for the next cycle. Clicking ‘apply again’ carries over their application.

![Prompt to apply again on the application dashboard.](application-unsuccessful-no-longer-possible-apply-again.png)

If the application does not lead to a place when the deadline to apply again has already passed, the usual ‘apply again’ email changes to reflect this:

{{ appEmail({
  subject: "Update on your application – all decisions now made",
  content: "Dear ((first_name)),

[If the candidate carries their application over before Apply reopens, they cannot submit](/apply-for-teacher-training/end-of-cycle-2021/#if-they-carry-over-before-apply-reopens%2C-they-cannot-submit) – as above.

[If the candidate carries their application over before Find reopens, they cannot find courses](/apply-for-teacher-training/end-of-cycle-2021/#if-they-carry-over-before-find-reopens%2C-they-cannot-find-courses) – as above.

## Candidates who create an account after the deadline to apply for the first time

[If the candidate creates an account before Apply reopens, they cannot submit](/apply-for-teacher-training/end-of-cycle-2021/#if-they-carry-over-before-apply-reopens%2C-they-cannot-submit) – as above.

## Timeframe to carry over an application

We have not set an end point for carrying over an application, but we’re assessing whether we should.

As it stands, the [carry over message when a candidate’s application does not lead to a place](/apply-for-teacher-training/end-of-cycle-2021/#if-it%E2%80%99s-too-late-to-apply-in-the-same-recruitment-cycle%2C-they-need-to-%E2%80%98carry-over%E2%80%99-their-application) and the [unsubmitted carry over message](/apply-for-teacher-training/end-of-cycle-2021/#they-need-to-%E2%80%98carry-over%E2%80%99-their-application-to-continue-working-on-it) continue to show indefinitely until the candidate actions it.

Wherever we refer to applying for courses starting in a particular year, such as in carry over messages or banners, it should always reflect the year the candidate is eligible to start a course in.

![‘Continue your application’ interstitial.](carry-over-year-later.png "Example: if a candidate started an application when it was possible to get on a course starting in the 2021 to 2022 academic year, but does not submit in time and does not sign back in until July 2023.")

## Letting candidates know that courses are open

Anyone who started or submitted an application for courses starting in the 2021 to 2022 academic year without securing a place gets an email letting them know when courses are open.

If a candidate started their application in the previous cycle but did not submit by their deadline:

{{ appEmail({
  subject: "Applications are open – apply for teacher training again",
  content: "((first_name_provided??Dear ((first_name)),))

### Applications are open – submit your teacher training application
