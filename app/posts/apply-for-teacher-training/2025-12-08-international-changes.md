##Background 

We have heard from research and support queries that training providers are receiving a high volume of applications from international candidates which they end up rejecting because applicants have not fully understood some important information such as: 
* course type 
* duration 
* fees 
* qualification type 

However the last round of research was in March 2023, so we wanted to understand whether this was a persistent problem. 

###Is this still a problem - do we still have the same level of international applications? 

Yes, 48.8k (44%) in the 2024 to 2025 recruitment cycle, 48.2k (46%) in the 2023 to 2024 cycle. 

Rejections are 25% higher for international candidates than domestic. 

###Have we resolved any of these issues? 

Visa sponsorship as a rejection reason for international candidates is down by half in the 2024 to 2025 recruitment cycle. 

 
## What did we do? 

We had heard that anecdotally some providers send candidates pre-screening questions to help both sides understand whether the course is appropriate for the applicant. 

We have added an interstitial page that gives candidates some further information on the course they are applying to in *either* of the following circumstances: 

A candidate has selected ‘citizen of another country’ for their nationality 

A candidate has selected ‘qualification from outside the UK’ for any of their qualifications. 

The main things that we wanted to let people know about were: 

###Fees and financial support 
Discovering too late in the process that they will not receive financial support is a big reason for candidate withdrawals among international candidates (4.36% of all withdrawals, 190% higher for international candidates than domestic candidates). 

It’s also always useful to highlight the increased fees for international candidates, we’ve heard that some people think this must also cover living expenses which is not the case. 

###Qualifications 
This is the biggest rejection reason for international candidates (42.89% of all rejections in the 2024 to 2025 cycle.) Whilst ‘supporting documents not provided’ is reasonably small at only 2.67%, this is 140% higher than for domestic candidates. 

###Ways to find out more 
We wanted to direct people to more information about anything that they’ve read on the ‘check before you send’ page so that they can give themselves the best chance of applying to the right course the first time they try.

##Updating the summary cards 

On the screen where candidates review their application we wanted to let people know about the fact that they need to produce original copies of qualifications and additionally that they need to be translated into English. This is relevant to all candidates regardless of nationality.

We also wanted to make changes that are specifically aimed at international candidates, to let them know about the higher fees in context when they are reviewing their application:

## Collecting structured data for some international degree grades 

If someone has got their degree from a UK university we ask them for their grade through structured check boxes that reflect the UK classification system : 
![Radio buttons showing the different degree classifications that can be selected: first class honours, upper second class honours, lower second class honours, third class honours, pass, fail](degree_classification_radios.png)

However we don't collect degree classification from international candidates in the same way, because different countries have different classification systems. If a candidate says that they got their degree from another country, we ask them to enter the classification in a free-text field. This gives us unstructured data. 

We did some research that showed us that there are [some countries which award degrees using the same classification system as the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-degree-equivalency-table-and-methodology): 

Nigeria - 9.34% of degrees 
Ghana - 4.14% 
Kenya - 1.33% 
Ireland - 0.45% 
Zimbabwe - 0.39% 
Sri Lanka - 0.19% 
Hong Kong - 0.14% 
Uganda - 0.09% 
Mauritius - 0.03% 
Lesotho - 0.01% 

These include some of the countries that we receive the most international applications from. Gathering structured data for the above will mean we go from having 71% of degrees in structured data to a total of 88%. 
Collecting structured data for degree classification means we can intervene when someone applies for a course that has a higher degree classification eligibility criteria than the degree they have entered in their details. 

We now show this degree grade interruption screen when someone for whom we have structured data on their degree classification applies for a course they are not qualified for:

## What’s next? 
There were other ideas in this piece of work that we haven’t made live yet. These are: 

Make it clearer who needs an English as a foreign language assessment 

updating the English as a foreign language question flow
