## Background

International candidates who need visa sponsorship need to apply earlier in the recruitment cycle because it takes around 90 days between them being accepted onto a course and them being ready to start on that course.  

The candidate needs to apply for their visa which has [a current processing time of 3 weeks](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visa-processing-times-applications-outside-the-uk#current-processing-times), but can take longer.  

The training provider does additional checks on international applications, for example verifying that qualifications gained overseas are equivalent to UK ones (either through UK European Network of Information Centres UK ENIC) or by contacting overseas institutions for confirmation. Some applicants will have to sit equivalency tests or GCSEs before starting their course. This adds significant time to the recruitment process.

Some candidates who require a visa are applying too late in the cycle for these checks to take place before the course starts.

## What we plan to do

**None of these changes have been pushed live into the services at this time.**

We will add a question to the Publish journey to ask providers who have said that they can sponsor visas whether they would like to close their course to candidates who need a visa before the course closing date.  

The training provider can select any date to close the course to candidates who need a visa.  

The new closing date will be shown to candidates who have indicated that they need a visa when they are searching for courses.

When they apply for a course with a closing date sooner than the end of the recruitment cycle they will see a banner warning them from when there are 6 days until the submission deadline on their applications page. The banner will persist on each of the remaining days before the deadline.

If they have applied to more than one course they will see a banner warning for each course with a visa submission deadline, stacked at the top of their applications page.

There will also be a warning banner on each application.

When the deadline has passed without the candidate submitting their application, they will see a note telling them what has happened and directing them to search for another course.

## Research with candidates and training providers

### Candidate research findings

We did some research with international candidates in March 2024 and we showed them some designs for the warning banners, the deadline on the course pages and the note that the deadline has passed.

We found that knowing the deadline is very useful for international candidates to help them prioritise their applications. It was very well received.

>“I think having a timeframe is so helpful. Before you waste your time. You cannot proceed to apply for something when you know that the time has passed.”

>“It’s very, very, very helpful. That will help me to streamline my applications so that I don’t waste my time putting in applications for courses that deadlines have passed.”

However some participants thought that the date was the deadline for applying for a visa rather than the deadline for the course. Some participants were also unclear on which of their applications the banner referred to.

We updated the content in the banners to specify not just the subject and subject code but also the training provider.

We also updated the content so that rather than saying ‘the deadline for visa sponsorship is [date]’ we say ‘the deadline for applications that need visa sponsorship is [date]’.

Some participants missed the notification that the deadline had passed and it was not clear to them why they could not submit their application.  

We made it more obvious by putting it into a warning component. There was some confusion about what was meant by ‘apply to another course’ so we have clarified with ‘apply to another course, subject or training provider who is still accepting applications.’

### Training provider research

In April 2024 we shared the new Publish screens with some training providers with a survey asking 3 questions:

* do the designs introduce a problem because we are asking for a specific date – would a date range be better?
* is 3 months enough time to process applications that need visa sponsorship so that candidates can start their course on time?
* does the content clearly explain what we are asking providers to do?

4 out of 5 participants understood that we were asking them to declare when they would like to close applications for participants who need a visa sponsorship. Only one participant wasn’t quite clear – they thought we would put in place a deadline for accepting candidates that need a visa.

All 5 respondents were comfortable adding a specific date to close applications for visa sponsored candidates. They did not have any concerns about deciding on a date when creating the course.

2 out of 5 respondents did not think 90 days was enough time to process applications for visa sponsored candidates.  

These two respondents pointed out that 90 days isn’t enough time to complete their checks on qualifications, references and give candidates enough time to meet any conditions for their offer (e.g. sitting GCSE, UKVI English Language tests).

“We require at least 90 days to allow applicants sufficient time to meet all  conditions of their offer (including sitting GCSE/UKVI English Language  tests).”

We changed the content to say ‘at least three months’ and ‘if you need more time to process these applications, set an earlier date.’

## Other considerations

We have not tested whether a candidate would want to dismiss the banners. Especially in the case that there are multiples as the banners will push their application information quite far down the page. We should consider this as a fast-follow for this work.

We can review use and see whether providers would want to re-open courses that they have closed. For the initial implementation we will not allow this functionality.
