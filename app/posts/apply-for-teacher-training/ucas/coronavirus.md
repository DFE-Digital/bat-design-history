On 18 March 2020, the government announced that [schools, colleges and early years settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/schools-colleges-and-early-years-settings-to-close) would close as part of a broader range of measures to reduce the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).

Given the impact on teacher training providers, UCAS and the department agreed to extend all decline by default (DBD) and reject by default (RBD) decision dates for a period of 4 weeks, up until 20 April 2020 at the earliest.

This is the email UCAS sent to providers:

{{ appEmail({
  content: "![Changes to decline by default (DBD) and reject by default (RBD) dates, and updating vacancy statuses](/apply-for-teacher-training/ucas/coronavirus/change-to-deadlines.png)"
}) }}
