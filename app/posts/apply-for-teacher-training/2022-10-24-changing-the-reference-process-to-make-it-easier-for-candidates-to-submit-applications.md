We made changes to how references are collected and sent to training providers.

This design history entry covers the change in the process. Other entries cover:

- [asking candidates for references to be contacted if they accept an offer](/asking-candidates-for-references-to-be-contacted-if-they-accept-an-offer)
- [asking candidates to confirm who reference requests should be sent to](/asking-candidates-to-confirm-who-reference-requests-should-be-sent-to)
- [letting candidates deal with references after accepting an offer](/letting-candidates-deal-with-reference-requests-after-accepting-an-offer)

## The issue

Candidates previously had to get 2 references before they could submit their application. This caused problems because:

- courses could become full while a candidate waited for their references
- some candidates would need to ask their employer for a reference, revealing that they were planning on leaving their job even though they did not have a place yet
- people were asked to spend time giving references for applications which were unsuccessful

In addition, receiving references with the application meant that providers used them as part of assessing candidate quality.

Research suggests that references are not a reliable way to assess whether a candidate is suitable for teacher training because people giving references:

- may not like to give negative references, or be told not to do so by the organisations they work for
- could be biased, whether intentionally or not
- may not know the candidate well enough to give a detailed reference

References were found to very rarely lead to rejection. Almost all rejections mentioning references were due to concerns about a candidate working with children.

We wanted to find a way to:

- make it easier for candidates to submit applications
- move the focus of references away from assessing the quality of candidates
- check whether there’s evidence that it is not safe for candidates to work with children
- reduce the amount of work done by people giving references, particularly those such as academic tutors who do so regularly

## Analysis

Analysis of data in May 2022 found that:

- 93.5% of candidates with unsubmitted applications had not completed the references section
- 2,011 candidates with unsubmitted applications only had the references section left to complete
- 49.4% of the candidates with only references left to complete had not entered details of anyone who could give them a reference
- 46.2% were awaiting a response for at least one reference

This suggested that changes to the references process could lead to significant increases in the numbers of candidates recruited.

## Other approaches we considered

We previously did some research on a [different approach to improving the references process](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/making-references-an-offer-condition/). Candidates would only give details of people who could give references when they accepted an offer.

This approach would make it even easier for candidates to apply but we decided not to follow it. We knew that training providers would be concerned about not knowing who candidates planned to ask for references.

## What we changed

We made changes to the way:

- candidates submit applications
- candidates accept offers
- people give references for candidates
- candidates check the progress of reference requests
- providers receive references

### Submitting an application

A candidate no longer needs to request and receive references before they can apply.

Instead, when they apply they have to give details of at least 2 people who can give a reference. They need to give:

- name
- email address
- how they know them and how long they’ve known them

Providers see these details but are told not to use them to contact people who can give references.

### Accepting an offer

When the candidate accepts an offer, they have to review the list of people which they gave when they applied. They can add or delete people from the list. This might be useful if, for example:
- they didn't originally include an academic reference but a provider has asked them to provide one
- they know that one of the people they listed is no longer able to give a reference
After any changes, there must be at least 2 people in the list in order for the candidate to accept the offer.

### Giving a reference

When the candidate clicks to accept an offer, this triggers emails to the people they said could give a reference. This happens even if there are no offer conditions and the candidate’s application has therefore moved into ‘recruited’ status.

The people who can give references are asked:
- to confirm what the candidate wrote about how they know each other
- whether they know any reason why the candidate should not work with children
- to give a factual reference, for example about the candidate's role and responsibilities if it's a professional reference
They’re no longer asked whether the candidate will make a good trainee teacher.

### Checking the progress of reference requests

Once the candidate has accepted the offer, they can sign into their account to:
- check the status of their reference requests
- send reminders to the people who can give them references
- cancel reference requests
- make additional reference requests
The service also sends automatic chaser emails to:

- candidates who have reference requests which have not been answered yet
- people who have been asked for a reference but have not given one yet

### Receiving references

A provider can see a reference as soon as it’s given.

It is not possible to mark references as acceptable or unacceptable. The provider can contact the candidate outside the service if they want to:

- ask for an additional reference
- tell the candidate that they’re happy with the references which have been given

If there were offer conditions, the provider can mark them as met or not met as usual.
