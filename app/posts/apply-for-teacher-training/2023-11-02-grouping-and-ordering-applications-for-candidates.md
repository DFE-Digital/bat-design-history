We included headings in between the list of applications a candidate sees when they start applying for teacher training. This was a simple approach to help candidates scan applications quickly while we redesign the application page.

This change was implemented in October 2023.

## The issue

When a candidate starts adding and submitting their applications, they can end up with a long list of applications.

We use a ‘summary card’ pattern to show each application. A candidate can have up to 15 applications in their list. These applications can have various statuses like:

- Not sent
- Awaiting decision
- Offer received
- Offer declines
- Condition pending
- Recruited
- Unsuccessful
- Application withdrawn

As the list gets longer, we wanted to group applications better so candidates can scan the list easier.

## What we did

We went through each status an application can have. We then made groups and ordered them by importance. For example, if a candidate receives an offer on an application, this application should move to the top of the list so that candidate can accept it.

The groups we decided on are:

- Offers received
- Unsubmitted applications
- Unsuccessful applications
- In progress
- Declined offers
- Withdrawn applications

Once we had grouped the different statuses, we gave each group a heading and added this to our prototype.

## Further considerations

We are also working on redesigning the page where candidates can see all their applications. The ‘summary card’ pattern worked well when candidates could only apply to 4 courses at a time.

Since we [changed the application process](/apply-for-teacher-training/changing-application-process), candidates can submit multiple applications and the summary cards take up a lot of space.

Once we have the new designs, we will test them with candidates.
