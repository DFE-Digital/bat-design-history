## User needs

**As a researcher**
I need to gather insights on how candidate’s feel about using the service
So that I can feed back user experience improvements to the service team

## Hypotheses

* If we prompt candidates to complete a feedback survey after they have submitted their application
  Then we will be more likely to get responses
  Because ‘Give feedback’ is the primary action on this page

* If we ask questions on the [system usability scale](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html)
  Then we will be able to measure a candidate’s satisfaction with the service
  Because this is an industry standard questionnaire

* If we split questions across multiple pages
  Then we can capture incomplete responses
  Because we will save the answer to each question

We’ll know this works if a high percentage of candidates completing their applications give measurable feedback.
