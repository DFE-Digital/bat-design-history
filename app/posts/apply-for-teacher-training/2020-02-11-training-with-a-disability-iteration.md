This design is [an iteration of the question as designed for the pilot](/apply-for-teacher-training/training-with-a-disability). This question was removed prior to launch due to a lack of confidence in how we were asking a sensitive and possibly contentious question.

## User needs

{% from "user-need/macro.njk" import appUserNeed %}
{{ appUserNeed({
  description: "As a candidate
I need to inform a provider of a disability, health issue or access need I have
So that reasonable adjustments can be made should I be offered an interview and/or begin training with them"
}) }}

{{ appUserNeed({
  description: "As a candidate
I need reassurance that disclosing a disability won’t affect my application, either due to unconscious bias or discrimination
So that I can feel comfortable disclosing this information"
}) }}

{{ appUserNeed({
  description: "As a provider
I need to know if a candidate needs extra support
So that I can accomodate their needs"
}) }}

## Hypotheses

### Using ‘extra assistance’ in the title

Using the word ‘disability’ in the title excluded candidates that have short-term physical or mental health conditions, or a condition they don’t regard as a disability.

If the question mentions ‘extra assistance’ instead of ‘disability’
Then candidates with access needs will be more compelled to enter their condition(s)
We’ll know this works when more candidates provide relevant details of their particular needs

### Using a more supportive and reassuring guidance tone (option one)

The original design used content largely adapted from that used on the Get Into Teaching website.

If we use more supportive and reassuring guidance, that includes examples of the type of support a provider can offer
Then a candidate will feel more comfortable providing an answer

### Reaffirming legal rights and protections against discrimination (option two)

The original design used content largely adapted from that used on the Get Into Teaching website.

If the guidance states that it's against the law for a provider to discriminate against candidates with access needs
Then a candidate will feel more comfortable providing an answer

## Findings

* Candidates read ‘extra assistance’ as meaning financial assistance.
* Candidates wanted links to information about financial assistance for training with a disability.
* Candidates wanted a mix of reassurance, and also information about their legal standing.
* Candidates were unclear what would happen with this information, or unsure if they would need to contact a provider directly as well.
* Providers asked for more varied examples of the types of support available (ie mental health).
