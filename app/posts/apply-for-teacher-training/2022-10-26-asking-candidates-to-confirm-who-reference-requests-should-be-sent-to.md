We’ve [changed the references process](/changing-the-reference-process-to-make-it-easier-for-candidates-to-submit-applications) so that candidates do not need to receive references before they submit their application. They instead need to [give details of 2 people who can give a reference](/apply-for-teacher-training/asking-candidates-to-confirm-who-reference-requests-should-be-sent-to/).

When they accept an offer, candidates are given the chance to change these details.

## The issue

Candidates give details of people who can give references when they apply, but they may need to make changes before the reference requests are sent.

This may happen for example if:

- they did not include details for an academic reference but a provider has asked them to provide one
- someone is no longer able to give a reference, so the candidate needs to choose a different person
- someone has changed their email address and therefore would not receive the reference request

## What we changed

We made changes to:

- the content of the page which candidates see if they sign in after receiving an offer
- the page showing the details of an offer

We also:

- added a new page asking candidates to confirm who can give them references
- removed the page which asks candidates to confirm that they want to accept the offer

### What candidates see if they sign in after receiving an offer

![Screenshot showing page with the heading ‘Your application‘. The introduction shows the heading ‘Congratulations on your offer‘ and the content ‘You have 14 days (until 4 Matrch 2021) to respond. If you do not respond, your offer will automatically be declined.’ A box contains details of the offer, including the name of the training provider, the course, the ‘offer received‘ status and the conditions of the offer. These conditions include ‘Fitness to train to teach check‘, ‘Disclosure and barring service check’ and ‘Verification of GCSE maths and English certificates‘. Text under this tells the candidate to contact the provider for more information and mentions that the provider needs to check their references. A link underneath lets the candidate respond to the offer and repeats the deadline. Links outside the box on the right of the page let the candidate view their application or withdraw from the course.](offer.png)

When a candidate signs in after submitting their application, they see a summary card for each of their applications.

If a provider has made an offer with conditions, the summary card includes a ‘conditions’ section. We’ve added content which mentions references:

“They’ll confirm your place once you’ve met the conditions and they’ve checked your references.”

### Details of offer

![Screenshot showing page with the heading ‘Details of offer‘. There is a table showing the provider, course, salart, location and conditions for the offer. Under this is a note saying that if the candidate declines the offer or does not respond it time, they’ll be able to apply again. It also has a link to get help from a teacher training advisor. At the bottom of the page is the question ‘How do you want to respond to this offer?’ The options are ‘Accept offer and conditions’ or ‘Decline offer’. There's a green button to let the candidate continue after choosing an option.](offer-details.png)

After the candidate clicks on the ‘respond to offer’ link, they’re taken to a page with details of the offer. This repeats the conditions but also shows additional details such as the fees or salary.

For an offer with conditions, this page also says “They’ll confirm your place once you’ve met the conditions and they’ve checked your references.”

### Asking candidates to confirm who can give them references

![Screenshot showing page with the heading ‘Confirm your reference details and accept your offer’. The text under this expplains that the candidate can change the reference details before sending reference requests. There's a button to add details for another reference. Under that is a box for the details of each reference request, including name, type, email and how long the candidate has known them and for how long. There's a link to delete each set of details and links to change the individual details. At the bottom is a green button which says ‘Accept offer’.](confirm-reference-details.png)


We added a page with the h1 heading ‘Confirm your reference details and accept your offer’. It is very similar to the page used to [add reference details before submitting an application](/asking-candidates-for-reference-details-when-they-apply).

The page shows the details which the candidate submitted as part of their application. For each person who can give a reference, the page shows:

- type
- name
- email address
- how the candidate knows them and for how long

Before they click to accept the offer, the candidate can:

- delete reference details, so that a reference request is not sent
- change reference details
- add details of another person who should receive a reference request

The ‘accept offer’ button only appears if the candidate has given details for at least 2 references.

After the candidate clicks the ‘accept offer’ button, they’re taken to a page where they can deal with their reference requests.

A success message appears at the top of the page they’re taken to, saying “You have accepted your offer for [course_and_code] at [provider]”. This message has not been changed.

### Deleting reference details

If the candidate clicks a delete link, they’re taken to a page asking them to confirm the deletion. This is the same as in the journey which is used to add references before submitting an application.

![TODO](delete-reference-details.png)

### Adding details for another reference

If the candidate adds a reference, they use the journey which is used to add references before submitting an application.

### References carried over from the old references process

![TODO](reference-already-given.png)

If a candidate originally applied before 4 October 2022, they would have used the old references process. This means that they would have received their references before submitting their application.

The candidate still sees the same reference request details. They do not see the reference itself.

The candidate can delete the details so that the training providers will not see the reference. They cannot change the details, so change links do not appear.

## Emails

The service sends an email to a candidate when:

- they accept a conditional offer
- they accept an unconditional offer

When the candidate accepts their offer, the service sends an email requesting references to each of the people whose details they gave.

## Further work

We need to add a message about references for unconditional offers, to match the one we show for conditional offers.
