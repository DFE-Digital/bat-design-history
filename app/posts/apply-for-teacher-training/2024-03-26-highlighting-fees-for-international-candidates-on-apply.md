As part of the [highlighting fees on Find service for international candidates](/find-teacher-training/highlighting-fees-for-international-candidates) work, we had to do the same on the Apply service, as there was no mention of fees for candidates during the application journey.

## What we changed

We added course fees when candidates submit their applications on the review page.

We also added course fees on other application statuses such as ‘awaiting decision’, ‘unsuccessful’, and ‘application withdrawn’, to serve as a reminder at different stages of their application.

## Further considerations

We are going to conduct some user testing to gain insight into international candidates' understanding and awareness of course fees in the new designs, and how this impacts the process of applying for their Initial Teacher Training.

We are also going to measure the success of this by tracking the number of withdrawals for ‘cost’ reasons.
