Universities do not usually have much flexibility when setting interview dates.

Several universities told us that the guidance on our [Interview preferences page](/apply-for-teacher-training/apply-launch#79-interview-preferences) suggests they have more flexibility than they do.

## User needs

As a provider, I need to be flexible when setting a date for interview in appropriate circumstances, so that candidates with varying circumstances can attend.

As a candidate, I need need my provider to accommodate my circumstances, so that I can go to the interview.

## Hypothesis

### Context

The data we have from candidates so far suggests candidates are not unreasonable in their requests.

However, some candidates have said they are not available on certain dates without giving a reason. Universities are unlikely to accommodate this, unless it fits in with the pre-arranged interview schedule.

Universities are more likely to be flexible if they know about a candidate's circumstances, for example:

* they're disabled
* they have caring responsibilities

### Our hypothesis

**If** we encourage candidates to tell us about their circumstances in the guidance

**Then** providers will try to accommodate them

**Because** they want to widen participation and avoid discrimination  

### How will we know this works?

 Weâ€™ll know this works when:

 * candidates understand what this section is for
 * providers get information that they're likely to take into account when setting an interview date

 We'll test the new content (refer to screenshot below) with users to see if we get the right results.
