## Background

Research with candidates who are pursuing a salaried route into teaching showed us that they would not consider fee-funded courses, even if invited to them by a provider.

Providers told us that they have been wasting time inviting candidates to courses that they won’t apply to because it’s not clear enough that they are only interested in salaried routes.

> "They have applied to 8 places but some are salaried, they need to be clear about what they want to apply for”

> “I've seen a lot of profiles that are only looking for salaried courses. Might be wasting everyone's time if they're only interested in salaried courses”

Providers have been inferring this information from a candidate’s profile by checking the previous applications. If they can see a candidate has only applied to salaried courses, they will not send them an invite to apply.

> “(Participant checks previous applications for fee-funded or salaried) I wouldn't consider those who have applied for salaried or apprenticeship routes only”

This could exclude candidates who have applied for salaried routes as a preference, but would consider fee-funded courses.

## What we did

### Candidates

We introduced a question for candidates who have applied to only salaried or apprenticeship courses. We ask them if they will also consider fee-funded courses.

This screen gives us the opportunity to let candidates know that their chances of being invited to a salaried course are low. We can also link to Get Into Teaching content about scholarships and bursaries which might support candidates to select a different (less over-subscribed) route into teaching.

### Providers

For providers we allow them to filter the list of candidates in Find candidates by those who will consider fee-funded routes. This includes candidates who have applied for:

* fee-funded routes only in the past

* salaried and fee-funded routes in the past

* salaried routes only but have indicated that they would consider fee-funded courses in their preferences
