## The problem we are trying to solve

In the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle we saw a 269% increase in applications from international candidates compared to the previous cycle, but a 25.8% reduction in the success rate of these applications.

Training providers reported that they were struggling to process the high number of applications because of the extra time required to check qualifications gained overseas to make sure that they match the entry requirements.

 It can take providers 10 times longer to process applications from international candidates. (From user research in December 2023)

Applicants are able to buy a certificate known as a statement of comparability from UK National Information Centre (UK ENIC) which shows how their international qualifications compare to ones gained in the UK.

The statement of comparability makes it easier for training providers to process applications from overseas because they can see how their qualifications compare to UK ones. It also increases the likelihood of the applicant receiving an offer by 28% (in the 2023 to 2024 cycle).

We wanted to increase the number of applications who submit with a statement of comparability to reduce the amount of time it takes providers to process international applications and increase the number of successful applications from international candidates.

## Research and analysis

(From the International Research review in February 2024)

Candidates said they:

* don't find out they need an ENIC until quite late in the application process
* don’t know what ENIC is
* don’t know why ENIC is important
* don’t know that it takes 15 working days to receive your ENIC reference number

Providers said they spend a long time trying to understand whether a qualification is equivalent to the UK ones specified in their entry requirements. Some mentioned lists of qualifications from other countries which they research and maintain themselves, or calling and emailing overseas universities to check qualifications.

## What we changed

### Changes to the ENIC entry screen

We wanted to give candidates more useful information earlier in their application process. Things we wanted to communicate to them:

* what an ENIC is used for and why providers want one
* everyone who gained their qualifications overseas should include an ENIC in their application (not just those who studied in a language other than English)
* there is a wait for your ENIC to arrive so you should make sure you have enough time to apply for one
* there is a cost of £49.50 plus VAT

We also included a link to the UK ENIC website from this page so that candidates could act on the information immediately and apply for their statement of comparability.

We discussed whether taking them out of the application process was too disruptive but in testing candidates said that they would be comfortable clicking the link to UK ENIC and returning to their application later. To mitigate for this we made the link open in a new tab so that their application form is maintained, and added a radio button for people who will apply later for their statement of comparability.

We included the statistic that including a UK ENIC number makes you 28% more likely to receive an offer. In research some participants didn’t find this number convincing enough. We changed it slightly to ‘almost 30% more likely’ which people agreed was more appealing.

### Interruption screen

We have added 2 variations of an interruption screen for candidates who try to submit their application without including a UK ENIC number.

If an applicant has selected ‘I’m waiting for (my statement of comparability) to arrive’ or ‘I will apply for one in future’ they will see a variation that reminds them to include the reference in their application before they submit it.

They can continue without adding it or they can return to the relevant part of the process to enter the number](/apply-for-teacher-training/ENIC/ENIC-interruption-screen-positive-answer.jpg)

If they select that they do not need a UK ENIC reference number they will see a variation of the screen which reminds them of the benefits of including one and the potential drawbacks of not.

### Rejection advice

If a candidate meets these criteria:

* gained their qualifications overseas
* has not entered a UK ENIC reference number
* is rejected for the reason ‘could not verify qualifications’

They will see bespoke content in both their rejection email and the applications page which will encourage them to apply for and include a UK ENIC reference number in their future applications.

#### Email content

> Showing providers how your qualifications compare to UK ones with a statement of comparability makes you around 30% more likely to receive an offer.
>
> You can apply for a statement of comparability from UK European Network of Information Centres (UK ENIC).
>
> If you want to apply again you should:
>
> * check that your details are still correct
> * add your UK ENIC statement of comparability to your profile
> * make sure you’re happy with your personal statement
> * find a course and submit another application
>
> Sign in to apply again.

## Next steps

Some weaknesses of the current designs include:

1. Our research showed that where a course is taught outside of the UK but in English, candidates do not believe they need a statement of comparability:

> “Because I feel my courses were taught in English when I was doing my undergraduate program, I feel I don’t need this (UK ENIC number)”

2. Leaving the application process to begin a new application on a 3rd party website could be disruptive and lead to increased drop outs.

3. Candidates could apply for a statement of comparability for some qualifications but not all – we do not know how common this is but it would affect the way they enter their reference numbers in our existing designs.

4. The statement of comparability gives providers proof that an overseas qualification type is equivalent to a UK qualification type, but it does not compare the grade or level. Some providers find it less useful than it could be whilst some candidates feel that they are at a disadvantage because their grades are not accurately represented.

5. The earliest point that candidates can find out about UK ENIC is still during their application. We should explore ways of flagging it earlier in their journey. Some small amends to the Find and Apply start pages are in progress with GOV.UK at the moment.

## How will we know if this has been successful?

In the 2023 to 2024 recruitment cycle 15% of applicants included a UK ENIC reference number in their application. We would like to monitor this number and see an increase caused by these changes.

We would like to see:

* a reduction in the time it takes providers to make an offer to overseas candidates (response time)
* a reduction in the overall number of applications from international candidates (because they will have a better understanding of whether they qualify for a particular course before they apply)
* an increase in the success rate of international applications
* a reduction in the rejection reason ‘unable to verify qualifications’

We will also track the number of applicants who are selecting ‘I will apply for one later’ and then not entering a reference number. This will tell us whether people are just clicking something to get past it and not really engaging with the content.
