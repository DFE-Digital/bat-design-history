## Background

The Apply for teacher training service has 12 reasons that a candidate can select from when they withdraw their application.

1. I am going to apply (or have applied) to a different training provider
2. I am going to apply (or have applied) to a different course at the same training provider
3. I have concerns about the cost of doing the course
4. The course is not available anymore
5. The wait to start the course is too long
6. I’ve decided to apply for teacher training next year
7. The training provider asked me to withdraw
8. The training provider has not responded to me
9. The location I’m expected to train at is too far away
10. I have concerns that I won’t have time to train
11. I have concerns about training with a disability or health condition
12. I do not want to train to be a teacher anymore  

In September we did some analysis that showed that almost half of all candidates who selected a reason, chose the first one ‘I am going to apply (or have applied) to a different training provider’ (16,064 out of 33,513). We hypothesised that people are choosing the option closest to the top of the list, rather than one that best suits their reason for withdrawing.

The reasons are also optional which means we don’t always get useful data about why candidates are withdrawing their applications. Having accurate data helps us to refine our services and policies.  

For example, knowing that the number of candidates withdrawing because they are worried about costs is rising, would give us some insight into the impact of increasing tuition fees.  

Knowing that candidates are withdrawing because the location they are expected to train at is too far away would show us that the availability of placements is not even across the country and help us to identify gaps.  

## Free-text analysis findings

All of the withdrawal reasons from 11 April 2023 to 20 September 2024 were analysed. Before 11 April our withdrawal reasons were structured differently so it was not possible to compare data from before this date.

* Candidates selecting ‘I’m going to apply (or have applied) to a different course with the same training provider’ mostly wanted to update their application.

They gave their reasons such as:
  “I want to improve my personal statement”
  “I added something to my personal statement so I want to withdraw this application and immediately apply again”
  “This provider has added a new school and I want to apply to that one instead”

* Candidates selecting ‘The wait to start the course is too long’ seem to want to select ‘The training provider has not responded to me’ instead. This reason only accounts for 0.8% of responses.

They gave reasons such as:
  “The training provider hasn’t responded yet”
  “It’s been 2 months waiting for a response so I am withdrawing my application”
  “Too long a wait for a reply”

* There is a lot of overlap between ‘I am going to apply (or have applied) to a different training provider’ and the other reasons. This could be because applying to another provider is an outcome rather than a reason.
  * 30% of respondents ticking this box had accepted an offer elsewhere. In this situation their other applications are all withdrawn automatically, so they don’t need to follow this manual withdrawal process.
  * 15% want to train with a provider in a better location for them. This is already an option.
  * 10% said that the provider took too long to respond, which is also already an option.
  * 7.5% said that the course was no longer available. This is also already an option.

Other withdrawal reasons are also outcomes of withdrawing rather than the reasons behind them.  

* I am going to apply (or have applied) to a different training provider
* I am going to apply (or have applied) to a different course with the same training provider
* I am going to apply for teacher training next year
* I no longer want to train to teach.

The existing withdrawal reasons are a mix of outcomes and reasons making it difficult for candidates to select the one that best suits their situation.  

For example, the free text analysis showed that people were selecting ‘I no longer want to train to teach’ and then adding free-text that indicated a change in personal circumstances such as health, finances or availability. Concerns about doing the course because of health conditions, concerns about the cost of the course and concerns about the time needed are all reasons in their own right, but candidates are not selecting them, because their mental model is to select the outcome, and then add the context of the reason.

## What did we do

We have restructured the withdrawal reasons to allow candidates to select an outcome first and then add the context of the reason.

### Outcomes

I am going to apply (or have applied) to a different training provider
I am going to apply (or have applied) to a different course with the same training provider
I am going to apply for teacher training next year
I no longer want to train to teach
Other.

### Reasons

#### I am going to apply (or have applied) to a different training provider

I have accepted another offer
I have seen a course that suits me better
The training provider has not replied to me

* I have concerns about the cost of doing the course
* I have concerns that I will not have time to train
* I have concerns about training with a disability or health condition
* Other
The course is not available anymore
Other

#### I am going to apply (or have applied) to a different course with the same training provider

I want to update my application, for example correct an error or add information
I want to change the study pattern, for example from full-time to part-time
I want to apply for a different subject with the same provider
Other

#### I am going to apply for teacher training next year

I want to improve my qualifications before I apply again
Other

#### I no longer want to train to teach

My personal circumstances have changed

    I have concerns about the cost of doing the course

    Other

I have decided on another career path or I have accepted a job offer
Other

‘My personal circumstances have changed’ is a reason that contains other sub-categories to explain what the change in personal circumstances is. We have repeated this as a reason in 3 of the 4 categories because a change in personal circumstances can reasonably be a reason for no longer wanting to train to teach, deferring your application until next year or applying to another training provider.  

The free text analysis did not show that people were reapplying with the same provider due to a change in personal circumstances, so we have not repeated this reason in that category.

We have removed ‘the training provider has asked me to withdraw’ as a reason. This answer accounted for around 3% of all reasons given, but more importantly providers have the ability to withdraw or reject candidate applications themselves, so there is no clear need for this route.

We also removed ‘the wait to start the course is too long’ as a withdrawal reason. We saw in the analysis that most people selecting this reason added context that they had not heard back from the provider yet, which is different from the course start date being too far in the future. We have kept ‘the provider has not responded to me’ as a withdrawal reason under the ‘I am going to apply (or have applied) to a different training provider’ category.

## Next steps

We have kept ‘Other’ as an option in both the top-level categories, the sub-categories and within the change of personal circumstances reasons.  

This will give us more free-text to analyse which will tell us whether we have got the categories right, or if candidates are still either mis-categorising their withdrawal reasons, or looking for reasons that we haven’t provided for them.  

We can review the withdrawal data again at the end of this recruitment cycle.  

We should also review support requests to make sure that making this step mandatory has not caused any blockers in the user journey.
