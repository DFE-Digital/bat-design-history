## Background

In July 2024 [UCAS announced](https://www.ucas.com/corporate/news-and-key-documents/news/new-personal-statement-help-level-playing-field-disadvantaged-students) that they will make changes to the personal statement section of the university application process in 2025:  

> The new approach will see a move away from a free text box, with students asked to respond to three structured questions instead.

We wondered whether our own applications process should mirror this approach for consistency between the 2 services.

We did a review of existing research and conducted new research on our own personal statement guidance to see whether we should follow this approach in the Apply for teacher training service.

## Research review

We have previously had a structured input for personal statements with 2 questions: why do you want to be a teacher and why are you suited to teach your subjects or age group. We made [the decision to merge them into a single text-input box in March 2023](https://becoming-a-teacher.design-history.education.gov.uk/apply-for-teacher-training/merging-the-personal-statement/?).

The main reasons for merging into a single text box were:

- having 2 questions was repetitive and the content overlapped too much
- candidates felt that they could not elaborate on their individual talents in the confines of the 2 questions
- candidates applying for primary courses struggled to differentiate between *why do you want to be a teacher* and *why are you suited to teaching primary school*
- providers had reported a decline in the quality of personal statements with the 2 question format.  

Our recent research reinforced these findings.  

But it also highlighted that the current single text entry box and general guidance was daunting for some candidates and they struggled to begin their personal statement. Some put it off for months which jeopardised their chances of getting onto a course in the current cycle.  

## Approach

### Current content

You should write between 500 and 1000 words for your personal statement.
Here are some examples you could write about (they are just a guide, you do not need to write about all of them):

Skills you have that are relevant to teaching
Any experience of working with young people
For secondary teacher training: your interest in the subject you want to teach
Your understanding of why teaching is important
Your reasons for wanting to train to be a teacher
Any activities you have done that could be relevant to teaching like first aid courses, sports coaching or volunteering

We did a content analysis of 8 different sources of personal statement guidance (including university, job and governing body websites) which showed that there are 3 main areas that candidates are advised to cover in their personal statement:

- skills and experience
- passion and motivation
- knowledge of the teaching landscape in the UK

There were 2 further areas which were covered but not as much or not as often:

- spelling and grammar
- specific information for overseas candidates.

We produced 3 questions based on the 3 most common areas and conducted a content crit with the Find and Apply and Get Into Teaching teams:  

1. Why do you want to be a teacher?
Describe what motivates you and your passion for teaching, your subject or the age group you want to teach.

2. What knowledge, skills and experience do you have that would make you a great teacher?
Describe your academic attainments, personal qualities, relevant experience of working with young people and your transferable skills.

3. Why is teaching important?
What are the rewards of a career in teaching? Are there any challenges in the profession and the sector?

The content crit highlighted that there was potential crossover between the first 2 questions and that the third question could disadvantage international candidates who wouldn’t have the knowledge of teaching in the UK that it asks for.  

Further discussion highlighted that recent graduates and career changers may also lack knowledge of the teaching landscape at this stage in their application process and would struggle to answer this question well. Question 3 was also felt to be too broad in scope and could be interpreted in many ways.

Question 1 included guidance on talking about your passion for your subject or age group in the hint text, but it was felt that this is really key information to bring out in a personal statement and it was hidden in this question.

Question 2 did not adequately offer career changers the opportunity to talk about their transferable skills gained in the workplace.

### Content iteration taken into use testing

Training providers are looking for people who are motivated by a career in teaching and the specific experience you have that makes you suitable for this course.  

Answer these questions in your personal statement

>1. Why do you want to teach this subject or age group

>2. What skills, experience and characteristics do you have that would make you a great teacher?

Include any relevant experience of working or volunteering with children and young people and any transferable skills or strengths that would support you in the classroom.
The most successful personal statements are between 500 and 1,000 words long, so make sure you include enough detail.

## User testing  

We conducted 5 interviews with candidates between Monday 2 and Friday 6 October 2024. 

We also shared the proposed guidance with 2 teacher training governing bodies: Universities' Council for the Education of Teachers (UCET) and The National Association of School-Based Teacher Trainers (NASBETT) and the network of teacher training advisers.  

Research participants fed back that:

- Question 1 (*why do you want to teach this subject or age group*) was confusing because it mentioned both subject and age group together and it wasn’t clear to candidates which of these should be tackled in which scenario (age group is for primary applicants to answer). Candidates applying for secondary teaching found it especially difficult to answer why they wanted to teach a specific age group.

- The mention of skills in question 2 (*what skills, experience and characteristics do you have that would make you a great teacher?*) was also difficult for candidates to interpret. It was not clear how skills were different to characteristics or experience which were also mentioned in the question.

- Question 2 was found to be overwhelming for one candidate with ADHD who said that they would struggle to know where to start with it and recommended breaking it down further.  

- Career changers reported being unsure of where to include their experience and it wasn’t clear to people where ‘life skills’ or experience gained through parenting should be included.

Teacher training advisers fed back that:  

- more focus on expertise at a high level and qualifications, rather than simply interest or passion in a subject was needed
- asking candidates to explain not just what but why something is important would be useful.

UCET and NASBETT did not highlight any concerns with the updated content shared with them.

We did a mid-research iteration of the content to make the following changes:

- change from questions and answers to ‘areas to write about’ to encourage more self-expression and individuality
- use of command phrases such as ‘explain how’ ‘reflect on’ and ‘describe why’ to encourage more reflective and considered responses
- specifically called out ‘life experience’ so that it’s clear where this kind of information should be included
- introduced a third question to collect responses about passion and motivation
- specified expertise gained through qualifications or work experience
- made it clearer that for primary courses candidates should talk about why they want to teach that age group, it’s not necessary for secondary candidates
- linked to the Get Into Teaching content about what to include in your personal statement for more support and guidance

### Updated content

Write about these 3 areas in your personal statement and reflect on how your knowledge, qualifications and experience make you suited to teaching.  

1. Explain why you want to be a teacher.
Reflect on what motivates you about a career in teaching.

2. Describe why you want to teach this subject. For primary, describe why you want to teach this age group.
Highlight your expertise in a subject gained through your qualifications or work experience.

3. Describe your relevant experience and personal characteristics and explain how they would make you a great teacher.
Discuss any relevant experience of working or volunteering with young people and any transferable skills or strengths gained through life experience that would support you in the classroom.

The most successful personal statements are between 500 and 1,000 words long, so make sure you include enough detail.

The iteration tested well. Participants felt that there would be some overlap between their answers for each of the sections, but since they were completing them in a single text box, this would not be a problem.

## Results

Overall, having structured guidance in these 3 areas helped direct candidates on what to cover in their statement. They reported that having this structure was less daunting than a single 1000 word question and that they understood what was expected of them.

They did also flag that having a structure could give the less flexibility to express themselves in their personal statements and lead to more generic responses. We should conduct more research with providers to see how much they value individuality in personal statements.

There is some overlap between the areas, with experience and motivation overlapping as well as experience and subject/age group. This may be more common with career changers or mature students who have more life experience, a longer career history, work experience and transferable skills.

There was no evidence that splitting the open text box into 3 distinct text boxes like UCAS would be beneficial to candidates or providers. There is some emerging evidence that it might be restrictive to candidates. Candidates reported that it could:

- prevent them writing in a fluid way that allows them to present their story in a way that accurately reflects them and their reasons for wanting to be a teacher
- make the answers repetitive because of the areas of overlap between the questions
- make their responses more formal and standardised because they are responding in a question and answer format.  

## Next steps

We have changed the guidance to the content that tested well for the start of the 2024 to 2025 recruitment cycle. Our research (like the research in 2023) did not support moving to 3 separate answer boxes following the UCAS model.  

We will monitor the following:

- rejections for reason: personal statement
- time to complete personal statement
- word count of personal statements submitted

We will conduct more research with providers to see how much a personal story or individual personal statement impacts their decision making process.
