## Background

The recruitment cycle dates are published on the [Apply service](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/provider/service-guidance/dates-and-deadlines) and on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recruiting-postgraduate-trainee-teachers-recruitment-cycle-dates/recruiting-postgraduate-trainee-teachers-recruitment-cycle-dates?).

Historically - up to and including October 2024 - we opened the cycle (Find opening) on the first Tuesday of October because that's what UCAS used to do. Apply would open a week after, on the following Tuesday.  

The reasons for the 1 week ‘air-gap’ between Find opening and Apply opening are:

* to give candidates time to draft and prepare applications prior to submission
* to give the service teams contingency time in case there are any issues in the technical opening of Find and to avoid significant load of our data bases in the same day
* often the financial incentives are not signed off until around the Apply open date so candidates don't have all the information they need to make an informed decision to apply until then  

However, opening the cycle on the first Tuesday of October resulted in the cycle opening later and later each year until it would reset to October 1 and 8, which naturally occurred for 2024.  

Without changing this pattern, the 2025 to 2026 cycle would open on October 7 and 14 2025 which is very late.  

So, we decided in September or October 2024 for it open on Wednesday October 1 and 8 2025, instead of the first Tuesday.

However, this would mean a discrepancy in our data when comparing weeks in the recruitment cycle year-on-year. Because our monthly reporting follows a Monday to Monday logic, the length of week 1 of the cycle would reduce by 1 day each year until we end up comparing 6 days of application data in 2024 to 4 days in 2027 making comparison impossible.  

## What did we do

Our recommendation is to open Find on the closest Tuesday (in working days) to October 1 (even if the date is in September). Apply opens a week later.  

In order to have comparable years to compare data year-on-year for making week-by-week comparisons and to avoid the open dates creeping too far into October we will use the following rules to determine cycle dates:

* decline by default date is always 2 days before Find opens  
* reject by default date is 3 working days behind the decline by default date  
* Application deadline is 6 working days before reject by default date  
* Cycles must be the same total number of days  
* Find should always open on the closest Tues to October 1
* We will keep the fixed one-week “air-gap” between Find and Apply opening.  

## Next steps

We should raise a cross-cutting research question about whether the cadence and timing of recruitment cycles still serve training providers and candidates.
