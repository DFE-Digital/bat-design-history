title: Changing how we ask about disabilities and health conditions
description: Why we no longer ask people if they are disabled, and instead show everyone a list of disabilities and health conditions.

We’ve changed the way we ask candidates about disabilities and health conditions in the equality and diversity monitoring questions shown just before submitting an application.

These changes have resulted in many more people selecting a disability or health condition.

## The issue

Previously, we asked an initial question of ’Are you disabled?’ with the options ’Yes’, ‘No’ and ‘Prefer not to say’.

If a candidate selected Yes, then we presented a list of checkboxes, with the question ’What disabilities do you have?’

The main issue with presenting the questions in this way is that some candidates who might have selected one or more of the checkboxes may not have done so as they do not consider themselves disabled. We had some evidence of this from user research sessions, where one user who was dyslexic commented that not everyone considers this a disability.

In addition, for the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle, the Higher Education Statistics Authority updated their recommended list of options to present.

## What we changed

We removed the first question, and instead present all users with a list of checkboxes.

We changed the question to ‘Do you have any of these disabilities or health conditions?’ and added a ‘I do not have any of these disabilities or health conditions’ option.

We added some content at the top of the page to confirm that a candidate’s answer is not shown to providers when they are deciding whether or not to offer a place on a course, and instead is only revealed if an offer has been accepted.

We also added a link back to the section of the application where candidates can ask for support if they are disabled.

We reviewed the content for each of the options, with the aim to front-load the most recognisable words and phrases, and to avoid using hint text except to give examples.

## Initial results

Comparing the first XX days of the 2022 to 2023 recruitment cycle to the first XX days of the previous cycle:

## Further considerations

We plan to continue including these questions within usability research sessions, so that we can see whether there are any further changes we could make.

We will review the work of other government departments, including the [Disability Unit](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disability-unit), the [Government Analysis Function impairment harmonised standard](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/impairment/) and the [GOV.UK Design System equality information pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/equality-information/) as they develop.
