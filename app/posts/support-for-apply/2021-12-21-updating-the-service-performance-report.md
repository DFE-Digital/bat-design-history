We wanted to improve the service performance report to make it easier for users to get the information they needed.

## What we changed

### Other changes

We formatted all numbers and percentages consistently using a comma to indicate thousands.

## Other considerations

We considered splitting the service performance data into different parts, such as:

- separating the data for candidates, applications and courses applied for
- showing numbers of candidates, applications and courses applied for by month

We decided that we will only do this extra work if we find that users need it.
