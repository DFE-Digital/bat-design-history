We offer 3 ways to find placement schools without signing in: by location, by initial teacher training (ITT) provider and by school. This keeps the barrier to entry low, meets different user needs and makes the data easier to check and reuse.

Each route solves a distinct problem. Together they help candidates, trainees, schools and sector partners find accurate information quickly.

## Why no sign-in?

Removing the need to sign in:

- reduces friction for early exploration and quick checks
- supports openness and reuse across the sector
- lowers support demand by removing account issues
- avoids collecting personal data when it is not needed
- allows schools and partners to verify information we already hold

We only gate features that change data or expose sensitive information.

## Why 3 routes, not one?

There is no single mental model for “find a placement school”. People start from different anchors:

- place first: “What is near me or near where I will train?”
- provider first: “Where does my provider place trainees?”
- school first: “I have a specific school in mind. Is it on the register and what is its history?”

Providing all 3 reduces dead ends, cuts rework and improves trust in the data. It also makes it easier to spot and report errors because users can triangulate results from different starting points.

## The 3 routes

### Route 1: By location

This route supports discovery. Users can start with a postcode, town or city and see schools within a chosen radius.

When it helps:

- early stage browsing by candidates and trainees
- planning placements in a local area
- understanding regional coverage and gaps

Benefits:

- matches how people think about travel and commute
- surfaces nearby options that users may not know by name
- encourages comparison on consistent attributes

Limits and mitigations:

- postcodes and names can be mistyped - we validate inputs and show clear errors where necessary
- distance alone can mislead - we present distance with context and let users refine by phase, type and status
- map views must be optional and accessible - all results are available as lists with keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Route 2: By provider

This route supports understanding relationships between providers and schools. Users can start with a provider and see a distinct list of schools they have worked with, including the associated academic years.

When it helps:

- trainees on a specific programme
- schools checking or starting a conversation with a provider
- DfE and sector colleagues reviewing coverage and relationships

Benefits:

- reflects how placements are organised in practice
- makes partnerships visible and checkable
- supports planning over time with an academic year view

Limits and mitigations:

- providers and schools can have similar names - we include differentiators such as UK provider reference number (UKPRN) and unique reference number (URN) in search and results
- partnerships change - we show academic year context and last updated dates, and we signpost how to report issues

### Route 3: By school

This route supports confirmation. Users can go straight to a known school by name, URN or UKPRN to see its profile and placement history.

When it helps:

- quick confirmation tasks
- resolving support queries about a single record
- policy and data work that depends on reliable identifiers

Benefits:

- reduces ambiguity caused by similar names
- speeds up tasks that need precise identification
- provides a single profile that brings attributes and history together

Limits and mitigations:

- schools change names or status - we keep historic identifiers and show status changes with dates
- some schools sit within groups or trusts - we display group information to aid recognition

## How the routes work together

Users can pivot between routes without losing context, for example from a school profile to nearby schools, or from a provider’s list to a school’s profile.

Shared filters and common attributes keep the experience consistent.

Identifiers (such as URN and UKPRN) link records across routes and between services, which supports data quality and reduces duplicate queries.

*[ITT]: initial teacher training
*[UKPRN]: UK provider reference number
*[URN]: unique reference number
