Following our initial consideration of [why we need a register of placement schools](/register-of-placement-schools/why-do-we-need-a-register-of-placement-schools/), we are now exploring what such a register would need to include and how it might function in practice.

## Definition of ‘placement schools’

In the context of teacher training, a placement school is a school that hosts a trainee for part of their course. These schools are also known as:

- school partners
- placement partners

Placement schools may provide:

- general school placements - core to all initial teacher training (ITT) courses
- subject-specific teaching placements
- intensive training and practice (ITaP) opportunities
- specialist placements in special schools, PRUs, or alternative provision

They form part of a wider training partnership that includes:

- an accredited ITT provider
- potentially, one or more training partners, but accredited ITT providers can choose to deliver the course without one
- at least two different placement schools

Schools can also be an accredited provider, known as School Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT) provider, or a non-accredited training provider, in partnership with an accredited provider, as well as a placement school. We therefore need to determine whether the register should model these roles distinctly or treat them as interchangeable, depending on the nature of the relationship between them.

## What the register might need to capture

At this early stage, we are identifying a working list of data the register might need to store for each placement school. This could include:

- school name
- URN (Unique Reference Number)
- school type and phase
- address and location (including geolocation)
- contact details
- subject or phase specialisms - for example, SEND (special educational needs and disabilities), primary, secondary maths
- relationship to a provider, such as a training partner and a placement partner
- status - for example, active and withdrawn

This information would support search, reporting, placement planning and the ability to publish accurate data to other BAT services.

## Relationships to other data and systems

The register would not operate in isolation. It would need to interact with:

- register trainee teachers to read from the same school data record
- the Register of training providers to link each school to a training partnership
- the Get Information about Schools (GIAS) database to validate and retrieve school details
- Publish teacher training courses (Publish), Find teacher training courses (Find), Apply for teacher training (Apply) and Manage teacher training applications (Manage)

We also need to understand what happens when a school closes or changes type, and how updates flow through from GIAS.

## What is out of scope (for now)

There are areas we are deliberately excluding while we explore the core scope:

- capturing individual placement availability (we expect this to remain managed within courses on Publish)
- modelling individual mentors or contacts at each school
- placement preferences or matching logic for Apply
- workforce capacity, quality assurance or Ofsted data (though this may be relevant later)

## Open questions

We are continuing to explore several questions with policy and service teams:

- What are the minimum data needs for each service?
- How frequently do provider-school relationships change?
- What should trigger a school to be added or removed?
- Who should be able to add or update a school in the register?

Can we use GIAS as the source for all schools, or will we need to allow manual entry?

## Next steps

We will:

- map the school-related data currently held across BAT services
- analyse where data overlaps or diverges
- begin user research with stakeholders to understand how they manage school data
- explore technical options for building on the existing register infrastructure

This work will help us decide whether to extend the current register or create a linked, but distinct, register for placement schools.
