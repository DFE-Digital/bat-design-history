Understanding what we mean by a ‘placement school’ is essential to building the Register of placement schools. A clear definition helps us design the data model, scope the service, and communicate consistently with users and stakeholders.

## Why definition matters

Placement schools play a central role in delivering initial teacher training (ITT). They host trainees for part of their course, providing real classroom experience and access to trained mentors. However, the language used to describe these schools varies, which can cause confusion for both service teams and users.

In different contexts, the same type of organisation may be described as:

- a placement school
- a school partner
- a placement partner

A shared, well-researched definition helps avoid ambiguity and ensures the service works for all user groups.

## What counts as a placement school

For the purposes of the Register of placement schools, we use ‘placement school’ as the standard term. A placement school is any school that:

- provides general school placements for ITT trainees
- supplies trained or trainable mentors to support those trainees
- may contribute to an accredited ITT provider’s school-based Intensive Training and Practice (ITP) element

Placements can take place in a wide variety of settings. As well as mainstream schools, this includes:

- special schools
- alternative provision
- pupil referral units
- mainstream schools with SEN resource units

This breadth is important because some accredited providers specialise in areas such as special educational needs and need access to schools with the relevant expertise.

## Why we chose ‘placement school’

We chose the term placement school for the register because it:

- uses plain English that makes sense to trainees, providers, and policymakers
- describes the function of the school in the context of ITT partnerships
- aligns with how most users currently talk about placements

Although other terms, such as ‘school partner’ or ‘placement partner,’ are used in sector conversations, they can also describe wider partnership arrangements beyond school placements. ‘Placement school’ is more precise and helps keep the service focused.
