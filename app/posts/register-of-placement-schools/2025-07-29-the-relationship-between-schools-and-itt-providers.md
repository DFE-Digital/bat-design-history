Schools work with accredited initial teacher training (ITT) providers and their training partners to deliver placements.

Accredited providers design the training programme and deliver it, often in partnership with training providers (non-accredited providers).

Schools are an essential part of training. School placements allow trainee teachers to get a variety of experiences to enable them to:

- meet all the teachers’ standards
- achieve qualified teacher status (QTS)

Each placement is planned and supported as part of the provider’s programme. The relationship is collaborative. Providers set expectations and support quality. Schools make space for trainees to learn, practise and reflect.

## The role of ITT providers

### Accredited providers

The accredited provider holds responsibility for the programme. It agrees placements with schools, sets out the curriculum and the assessment approach, and trains and supports mentors. It makes sure placements meet the programme’s aims and are safe and well run. It maintains oversight when other organisations help to deliver training.

This responsibility can be delegated to the accredited provider’s training partners.

### Training partners

Training partners work with one or more accredited providers to deliver parts of the ITT programme. They help source placements, provide subject or phase training, coordinate mentor development, or run elements such as intensive training and practice. Training partners operate under the direction of the provider. The provider remains accountable for quality and outcomes.

## The role of schools

### What schools offer

Schools provide the setting in which trainees apply their knowledge and skills. Typically, they offer:

- placements within the school timetable
- access to classrooms, pupils and resources
- observation, feedback and opportunities to reflect
- mentors, usually practising teachers in the host school
- pastoral support and professional guidance

Some schools also support intensive training and practice, where trainees focus on specific, rehearsed aspects of teaching. Capacity varies by school, subject and time of year.

## The role of the academic year

Placement planning and partnership activity follow the academic year. This gives a clear cycle for planning, delivery and review. Schools may have different capacities each year. Providers may adjust subjects, phases or placement patterns year to year. Treating the relationship through the lens of the academic year helps everyone talk about the same period, compare like with like, and plan.

## Working with many providers

A school can host trainees from several providers in the same academic year. This is common, especially in larger schools or trusts. It can also work with different providers across different years as supply, demand and local partnerships change.

In the same way, an accredited provider places trainees across many schools. The network of relationships is many-to-many and evolves over time.
