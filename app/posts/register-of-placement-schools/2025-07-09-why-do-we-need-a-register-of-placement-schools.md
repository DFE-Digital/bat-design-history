title: Why do we need a register of placement schools?

Placement schools are an integral part of every initial teacher training (ITT) course. They host trainee teachers on placement, provide school-based training, and supply mentors to support professional development. These schools are also referred to as placement partners or school partners.

While the accredited ITT provider leads the partnership, and training partners may help coordinate activity, it is the placement school that facilitates the essential in-school experience that trainee teachers require. Every trainee must attend at least two different school placements.

Placements may take place in a range of settings, including:

- mainstream schools
- special schools
- pupil referral units
- alternative provision
- special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) resource bases

Some schools also contribute to the intensive training and practice (ITaP) element of a training course, where that is part of the ITT partnership’s offer.

## The problem

There is currently no central register of placement schools. Each service in the Becoming a teacher (BAT) service line holds or displays school data separately:

- Publish teacher training courses (Publish) requires providers to input school details as part of the publication of each course

- Find teacher training courses (Find) uses the location of placement schools attached to courses to power the location search function. In addition, providers can choose to display the schools as part of the course information

- Apply for teacher training (Apply) lets candidates view and choose from available placement schools, if the provider has allowed this, but the default setting is for the information to be no longer displayed

- Register trainee teachers enabled providers to add the placement schools to a trainee record, to capture where the trainee undertook their placements

Because this data is not centralised or consistent, the same problems arise that led us to create the [Register of training providers](/register-of-training-providers/why-we-need-a-register-of-training-providers/):

- Inconsistent and outdated data - Services display different information for the same school. A school shown as available on Find might already be full or withdrawn. Names, addresses or types of schools may also be recorded differently across services.

- It is difficult for candidates to find the correct placement - Candidates report struggling to find schools they know exist. They want to be able to filter by location, placement type, subject, or provider, and sometimes view this information on a map.

- Duplicate effort and unnecessary complexity for providers - Training providers must input and maintain the same school details across several services. This is inefficient and increases the chance of error. If a school changes address, name or placement availability, it must be updated in multiple places.

- The DfE cannot see a complete or accurate picture - Without a single register, it is challenging for the DfE to understand which schools are involved in ITT partnerships. This limits the department's ability to monitor, fund, and support the sector effectively.

## What a register would do

A register of placement schools would provide a single, authoritative source of truth for school-level placement data. It would:

- ensure each school is recorded once, with consistent and accurate details
- let providers update school information in one place
- allow services like Find, Apply, Register and Publish to draw from the same shared data
- help candidates search and view placements more easily
- improve DfE's oversight of which schools participate in ITT

This would reduce duplication, improve data quality, and enhance the overall user experience across the service line.

## Related user needs

We have heard consistent user needs in research and support tickets that a register would help meet:

- Candidates want to find local and relevant school placements more easily
- Providers want a more straightforward way to manage their placement school data
- DfE wants a clearer picture of where placements are happening and who is involved

## Next steps

We will explore how to adapt the design and structure of the Register of training providers to support school-level placement data. We will work with policy, digital, and delivery teams across the BAT services to understand the scope, priorities and constraints.
