When building the Register of placement schools, we needed to clarify how a placement school differs from a school as defined in existing datasets, particularly the [Get information about schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) service.

This distinction matters because the Register is not simply another copy of GIAS. Instead, it captures a different relationship: which schools are actively involved in delivering initial teacher training (ITT) placements, and in what context.

## Schools in GIAS

GIAS is the Department for Education’s official source of school data. It lists all schools in England, including details such as:

- school type and governance
- admissions policy
- address and contact details
- religious character
- age range and phase

GIAS is broad and comprehensive, covering every school that is open, closed, or due to open. But it does not describe the school’s role in ITT.

## Placement schools in the Register

The Register of placement schools builds on GIAS data but introduces a different lens. A placement school is a school that:

- provides general school placements for ITT trainees
- supplies mentors to support those trainees
- may contribute to the Intensive Training and Practice (ITP) element of an ITT course

This means not every school in GIAS will appear in the Register. A placement school is defined not just by its status as a school, but by its relationship with accredited ITT providers and their training partners.

## Similarities and differences

### Similarities

- Both rely on official identifiers, such as the Unique Reference Number (URN), to ensure consistent records

- Both record the same underlying legal entity: a school in England recognised by DfE

### Differences

- GIAS is descriptive: it says what a school is (its type, governance, location)

- The Register is relational: it shows how a school participates in ITT partnerships over time

- GIAS includes all schools; the Register includes only those working with accredited providers to host placements

## Why this matters

Defining a placement school in relation to GIAS ensures consistency while avoiding duplication. It allows us to:

- reuse trusted data about schools where possible
- link registers together through identifiers like URN
- focus the Register on the unique value it provides: understanding which schools are actively engaged in ITT
