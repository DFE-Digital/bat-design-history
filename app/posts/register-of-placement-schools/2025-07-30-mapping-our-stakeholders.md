    title: Mapping our stakeholders
---

As we continue our work on the Register of placement schools (RoPS), we stepped back to map the people and organisations with a stake in the service.

Understanding our stakeholders, their influence, and how the service affects them is essential. It helps us design the right thing, for the right people, at the right time.

We are sharing the map here for transparency and to invite feedback.

## How we built the stakeholder map

We used a simple stakeholder mapping approach. On the horizontal axis we plotted how much the service affects each stakeholder group. On the vertical axis we plotted how much influence each group has over the service or how it runs.

To inform the map, we ran workshops with colleagues from Find teacher training courses, Apply for teacher training, and Register trainee teachers. Each session gave us that team’s view of the landscape. We asked who they work with, who they rely on, and who relies on them.

We combined these perspectives to create a single stakeholder map for RoPS. This shared view helps us spot overlaps, clarify responsibilities, and understand how RoPS fits within the wider initial teacher training (ITT) ecosystem.

The result is a map divided into four quadrants:

1. Manage closely (high impact, high influence)
2. Keep satisfied (low impact, high influence)
3. Keep informed (high impact, low influence)
4. Monitor (low impact, low influence)

## Who’s on the map

[![Stakeholder map](stakeholder-map.png "Stakeholder map")](stakeholder-map.png)

Here’s how we have placed our current stakeholder groups:

### Manage closely

Stakeholders that are highly influential and highly affected by the service. We will involve them closely, collaborate often, and make sure their needs shape the work.

- placement schools
- accredited providers
- training partners
- Becoming a teacher (BAT) policy team
- Becoming a teacher (BAT) service teams
- Becoming a teacher (BAT) support team
- Market regulations team

### Keep satisfied

Groups with influence that are less directly affected. We will keep them in the loop and manage expectations.

- DfE policy teams outside BAT
- DfE Sign-in
- platform, security and hosting teams
- information governance and data protection teams

### Keep informed

Groups that will feel the impact of the service but have limited influence over it. We will keep them up to date and listen to feedback.

- initial teacher training (ITT) funding team
- industry bodies such as the [National Association of School-Based Teacher Trainers (NASBTT)](https://www.nasbtt.org.uk/) and the [Universities Council for the Education of Teachers (UCET)](https://www.ucet.ac.uk/)
- Teacher Analytics Division (TAD)
- Teacher Records System (TRS)
- [Get Into Teaching (GIT)](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/)

### Monitor

Groups that are less affected and have less influence. We do not need to engage them regularly, but we should stay aware and note any change in interest or influence.

- [Get information about schools (GIAS)](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/)
- [Ofsted](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted)
- [UK register of learning providers (UKRLP)](https://www.ukrlp.co.uk/)
- software vendors that integrate with provider and school systems
- other data suppliers, such as address and mapping services

This map will change as we learn more and as the service develops. If you think someone is missing or in the wrong place, please tell us.

## What is different for RoPS

Compared to the Register of training providers, schools play a central role here. RoPS focuses on the relationships between accredited providers, training partners and the schools that host placements. That shift highlights the need to consider a possible public view for candidates and trainees.

## What’s next

Mapping stakeholders is one step in understanding the ecosystem around RoPS. It helps us plan engagement, test ideas with the right people, and surface risks early.

We will keep the map under review and share updates as we go.
