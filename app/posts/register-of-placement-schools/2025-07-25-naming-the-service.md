The name of a service does a lot of heavy lifting. It should make sense to the people who need to use it, stand up to scrutiny, and remain relevant as the service develops.

A well-chosen name helps people:

- locate the service quickly on GOV.UK or through search engines
- understand its purpose without needing to read further
- decide if it is the right place for what they need to do

It also gives delivery teams, policy colleagues and support staff a shared way of talking about the service.

## What makes a good name

The [GOV.UK service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service) sets out principles that we follow when naming services. Strong service names:

- use familiar language from user research and analytics
- explain what the service is for, not how it works
- steer clear of policy terms, acronyms or internal structures
- are written in plain English rather than marketing language
- avoid department names or branding

These rules are designed to keep names clear and centred on user needs, even if the service changes behind the scenes.

## Why we chose ‘Register of placement schools’

This service is about providing a reliable public record rather than enabling a single transaction. In these cases, a noun-based name can be more accurate and easier to recognise.

We chose ‘Register of placement schools’ because:

- ‘placement schools’ is already the phrase providers use to describe the schools where trainees spend part of their training
- ‘register’ signals an authoritative, maintained list, consistent with how government names similar services, such as the [Register of charities](https://www.gov.uk/find-charity-information)
- the name describes the information the service contains, not an action users need to carry out

It is important to note that schools are not applying to be on the register through this service. Their status comes from existing regulatory processes. This service makes the register available and keeps it up to date for providers, policymakers and the public.

## How we will know if the name works

We will review how the name performs by:

- analysing search data to see which terms bring people to the service
- listening in research sessions to the words people naturally use
- checking whether people link the service correctly with related ones like Register of training providers, Publish teacher training courses and Apply for teacher training
- watching out for confusion with other registers or education services
- noting how colleagues and stakeholders refer to it in day-to-day conversations

If we find persistent problems, we will test alternatives. Naming is part of an ongoing design process, not a single decision.
