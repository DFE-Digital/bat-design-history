https://bat-design-history.netlify.app

## Purpose of this project

This repository makes it easy to:

* screenshot your designs
* create pages of screenshots to document designs
* document designs using the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
* print pages of designs
* make designs shareable and linkable

## Installation

* Clone this repository to a folder on your computer
* Open Terminal
* In Terminal, change the path to the repository
* Type `npm install` to install the dependencies

## Working locally

Most of the time you'll be adding new posts. If you're just doing this then:

* Open Terminal
* Type `npm run watch`

This will automatically restart the application with any changes to Markdown, images, CSS, JavaScript applied.

## Technical notes

The design history uses the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk) and the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator.
